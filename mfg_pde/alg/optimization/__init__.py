"""
Optimization paradigm for MFG problems.

This module contains direct optimization approaches for solving Mean Field Games:
- variational_solvers: Lagrangian formulation and variational methods
- optimal_transport: Wasserstein distance and optimal transport methods

All methods are based on direct optimization of cost functionals,
providing alternatives to the classical HJB-FP system approach.

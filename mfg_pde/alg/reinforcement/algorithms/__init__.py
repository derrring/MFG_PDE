"""
Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Mean Field Games.

This module contains RL algorithms specifically designed for MFG problems,
where agents learn policies and value functions that depend on both individual
state and population state (mean field).

Available Algorithms:

Single-Population Algorithms:

Discrete Action Spaces:
- MeanFieldQLearning: Value-based learning with Q(s,a,m)
- MeanFieldActorCritic: Policy gradient with actor-critic architecture

Continuous Action Spaces:
- MeanFieldDDPG: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for continuous control
- MeanFieldTD3: Twin Delayed DDPG with target policy smoothing
- MeanFieldSAC: Soft Actor-Critic with maximum entropy objective

Multi-Population Algorithms (N â‰¥ 2 interacting populations):

Continuous Action Spaces:
- MultiPopulationDDPG: DDPG for heterogeneous populations
- MultiPopulationTD3: TD3 for heterogeneous populations with twin critics
- MultiPopulationSAC: SAC for heterogeneous populations with entropy regularization

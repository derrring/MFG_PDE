"""
Neural methods for stochastic Mean Field Games.

This module provides neural network-based solvers for stochastic MFG:
- Stochastic PINNs for high-dimensional problems
- Master equation neural solvers

Note: Solvers will be implemented in subsequent phases.
Placeholder for Phase 2.2 Week 7-8 implementation.

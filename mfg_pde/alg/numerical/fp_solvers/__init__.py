"""
Fokker-Planck equation solvers using numerical methods.

This module provides classical numerical analysis approaches for solving
individual Fokker-Planck equations, including:
- Finite difference methods (FPFDMSolver)
- Particle-based methods (FPParticleSolver)
- Semi-Lagrangian methods (FPSLSolver)
- GFDM meshfree methods (FPGFDMSolver)

Semi-Lagrangian Variants (Issue #710):
- FPSLSolver: Forward SL (scatter/splat) - adjoint of HJB SL, RECOMMENDED
- FPSLJacobianSolver: Backward SL with Jacobian correction - DEPRECATED

Note: FPSLAdjointSolver is a deprecated alias for FPSLSolver (renamed in v0.17.6).

Internal modules (Issue #635 refactoring):
- fp_particle_density: Dimension-agnostic density estimation utilities
- fp_particle_bc: Dimension-agnostic boundary condition handling

Note: Network solvers have been moved to `mfg_pde.alg.numerical.network_solvers`.
FPNetworkSolver is re-exported here for backward compatibility.

class BaseFPSolver(BaseNumericalSolver):
    """
    Abstract Base Class for Fokker-Planck (FP) equation solvers.

    The FP equation describes density evolution:
        ∂m/∂t + ∇·(α m) = ∇·(D ∇m)

    where:
        m(t,x): probability density
        α(t,x,m): drift field (from various sources)
        D(t,x,m): diffusion tensor (isotropic, anisotropic, or state-dependent)

    Drift Sources (controlled by drift_field parameter):
        - Zero: α = 0 (pure diffusion)
        - Optimal control (MFG): α = -∇U (most common)
        - Prescribed field: α = v(t,x) (wind, currents)
        - Custom/state-dependent: α = f(t,x,m)

    Diffusion Types (controlled by diffusion_field parameter):
        - Constant isotropic: D = σ²/2 (scalar, same in all directions)
        - Anisotropic: D = diag(σ₁², σ₂², ...) (different per direction)
        - Spatially varying: D(t,x) (depends on location)
        - State-dependent: D(t,x,m) (nonlinear, depends on density)
        - Zero: D = 0 (pure advection, requires WENO/SL)

    This base class provides a general, powerful interface supporting all drift and
    diffusion types while maintaining backward compatibility with MFG-centric usage.

    Design Philosophy:
        Make simple cases simple (MFG with constant diffusion), make complex cases
        possible (anisotropic, state-dependent, spatially varying). The solver
        handles drift and diffusion computation based on provided parameters.

    Note for Implementers:
        When implementing concrete solvers:
        - Handle D=0 (pure advection) carefully - FDM may be unstable, use WENO/SL
        - Support anisotropic diffusion tensors for realistic applications
        - Enable state-dependent coefficients for nonlinear PDEs

        Examples:
            # Pure diffusion (heat equation, D>0, α=0)
            >>> M = solver.solve_fp_system(m0)

            # MFG optimal control (isotropic diffusion)
            >>> drift = -problem.compute_gradient(U_hjb) / problem.control_cost
            >>> M = solver.solve_fp_system(m0, drift_field=drift)

            # Anisotropic diffusion
            >>> D = np.diag([0.1, 0.5])  # Different in x,y directions
            >>> M = solver.solve_fp_system(m0, drift_field=drift, diffusion_field=D)

            # State-dependent diffusion
            >>> D_func = lambda t, x, m: 0.1 * (1 + m)  # Increases with density
            >>> M = solver.solve_fp_system(m0, drift_field=drift, diffusion_field=D_func)

            # Pure advection (D=0, α≠0)
            >>> M = solver.solve_fp_system(m0, drift_field=drift, diffusion_field=0.0)

            # Spatially varying diffusion
            >>> D_field = create_spatially_varying_diffusion(...)  # (Nt, Nx)
            >>> M = solver.solve_fp_system(m0, drift_field=drift, diffusion_field=D_field)

        Note:
            For MFG problems:
            - drift = -∇U / λ (user computes externally)
            - diffusion = problem.sigma (default) or custom
            This gives full control over both drift and diffusion.

        Helper Functions (Phase 2):
            For convenience and clarity, drift helper functions are available:

            >>> from mfg_pde.utils import (
            ...     zero_drift,
            ...     optimal_control_drift,
            ...     prescribed_drift,
            ...     density_dependent_drift,
            ...     composite_drift,
            ... )

            These helpers return callables with clear intent. Callable drift support
            is planned for Phase 2. Current solvers (v0.13) support None and np.ndarray.

            See mfg_pde.utils.drift_helpers for details.

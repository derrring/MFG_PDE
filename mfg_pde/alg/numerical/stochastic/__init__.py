"""
Numerical methods for stochastic Mean Field Games.

This module provides numerical solvers for stochastic MFG formulations:
- Common Noise MFG: Monte Carlo over noise realizations
- Master Equation: Functional PDE solvers

Note: Solvers will be implemented in subsequent phases.
Placeholder for Phase 2.2 Week 3-8 implementation.

"""
Numerical methods paradigm for MFG problems.

This module contains classical numerical analysis approaches:
- hjb_solvers: Individual HJB equation solvers (grid-based)
- fp_solvers: Individual Fokker-Planck solvers (grid-based)
- network_solvers: HJB and FP solvers for graph/network domains
- coupling: MFG coupling methods (Picard, Policy iteration, etc.)

All methods are based on discretization and convergence analysis.
Note: FP solvers maintain backward compatibility with original interfaces.

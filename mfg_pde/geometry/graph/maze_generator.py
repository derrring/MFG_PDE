"""
Perfect Maze Generation for MFG-RL Environments

Implements classic maze generation algorithms for creating guaranteed-solvable
maze environments for reinforcement learning experiments.

All algorithms produce perfect mazes with two critical properties:
1. Fully Connected: Path exists between any two cells
2. No Loops: Exactly one unique path between any pair of cells

Implemented Algorithms:
- Recursive Backtracking (DFS): Long winding paths, high exploration difficulty
- Wilson's Algorithm: Unbiased sampling, structural diversity
- Eller's Algorithm: Efficient row-by-row generation, O(width) memory
- Growing Tree: Flexible framework, balanced characteristics

Mathematical Foundation:
Perfect mazes are minimal spanning trees on grid graphs, ensuring:
- Connectivity: |V| vertices connected by |V|-1 edges
- Acyclicity: No loops in the graph structure
- Uniqueness: Exactly one path between any two vertices

"""
Visibility queries for meshfree methods in domains with obstacles.

Provides line-of-sight checking between points using signed distance functions (SDF).
Primary use case: filtering GFDM stencil neighbors to prevent "cross-wall" stencils
in narrow channels between obstacles.

The core idea is simple: sample the SDF along the line segment between two points.
If any sample falls inside an obstacle (SDF < 0), the line of sight is blocked.

SDF Convention (consistent with mfg_pde.geometry.implicit):
    phi(x) < 0  =>  x inside obstacle (blocked)
    phi(x) = 0  =>  x on obstacle boundary
    phi(x) > 0  =>  x outside obstacle (clear)

Note: The obstacle_sdf here should be the SDF of the *obstacle region* (e.g., a
UnionDomain of pillars), NOT the full computational domain. For a DifferenceDomain
(rectangle minus pillars), pass the SDF of the pillars union.

Example:
    >>> from mfg_pde.geometry.implicit import Hypersphere, UnionDomain
    >>> pillars = UnionDomain([
    ...     Hypersphere(center=[6.0, 3.5], radius=1.3),
    ...     Hypersphere(center=[6.0, 6.5], radius=1.3),
    ... ])
    >>> from mfg_pde.geometry.visibility import filter_visible_neighbors
    >>> mask = filter_visible_neighbors(
    ...     center=np.array([5.0, 5.0]),
    ...     candidates=candidate_points,
    ...     obstacle_sdf=pillars.signed_distance,
    ... )
    >>> visible_candidates = candidate_points[mask]

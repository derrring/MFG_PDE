"""
Unified geometry protocol for MFG problems.

This module defines the protocols that all geometry objects must satisfy:
- GeometryProtocol: Core geometry interface (dimension, points, grid)
- BoundaryAwareProtocol: Boundary information interface (detection, normals, projection)

The separation allows BC applicators to work with any geometry that provides
boundary information, while keeping geometry definition and BC application separate.

Created: 2025-11-05
Updated: 2025-11-27 - Added BoundaryAwareProtocol for unified BC handling

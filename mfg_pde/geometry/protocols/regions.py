"""
Region and boundary trait protocols for geometry capabilities.

This module defines Protocol classes for boundary-related geometry capabilities:
- Boundary normal computation
- Boundary projection
- Signed distance function (SDF) evaluation
- Region marking and query

These protocols enable geometry-agnostic BC application and region-based
problem setup (mixed BCs, obstacle definitions, etc.).

Example:
    # Mark region for mixed BC
    if isinstance(geometry, SupportsRegionMarking):
        geometry.mark_region("inlet", lambda x: x[0] < 0.1)

    # Apply BC to marked region
    bc_segment = BCSegment(
        name="inlet_bc",
        bc_type=BCType.DIRICHLET,
        value=1.0,
        boundary="inlet",  # References marked region
    )

    Geometry can compute outward normal vectors at boundary points.

    Universal Outward Normal Convention (Issue #661):
        - n points FROM domain interior TO exterior
        - ∂u/∂n > 0 means u increases in the outward direction
        - For reflecting BC: velocity component along n reverses sign
        - For SDF φ (with φ < 0 inside, φ > 0 outside): n = ∇φ / |∇φ|

    Applications:
        - Neumann BC (∂u/∂n = g): Need normal direction for derivative
        - Robin BC (αu + β∂u/∂n = g): Need normal for mixed condition

"""
Graph-specific trait protocols for discrete geometry capabilities.

This module defines Protocol classes for graph geometry capabilities that parallel
the continuous geometry traits but reflect the discrete nature of graphs:

- Graph Laplacian (L = D - A) for discrete diffusion
- Adjacency matrix for connectivity
- Spatial embedding for positioned graphs
- Graph-theoretic distances

These protocols enable trait-based solver design for MFG on networks while
maintaining consistency with the continuous geometry trait system.

Example:
    def solve_network_mfg(geometry: SupportsGraphLaplacian):
        L = geometry.get_graph_laplacian_operator()
        # Discrete diffusion: dm/dt = -Lm
        m_new = m - dt * (L @ m)

Design Principle:
    Graph traits use the same naming pattern (Supports*) as continuous traits,
    but with semantics appropriate for discrete topology.

    Geometry can provide discrete graph Laplacian operator.

    Graph Laplacian encodes network connectivity and diffusion structure.
    Unlike continuous Laplacian Δ which operates on fields, graph Laplacian L
    operates on node values via matrix multiplication.

    Mathematical Definition:
        L = D - A  (unnormalized Laplacian)
        L_norm = I - D^(-1/2) A D^(-1/2)  (normalized Laplacian)

    where:
        - D = diag(∑ⱼ Aᵢⱼ) is the degree matrix
        - A is the adjacency matrix
        - I is the identity matrix

    Properties:
        - L is symmetric and positive semi-definite
        - Smallest eigenvalue is 0 (constant eigenvector)
        - Spectrum encodes graph structure (spectral clustering)

    Used For:
        - Discrete diffusion: ∂m/∂t = -σ²Lm
        - Random walks on graphs
        - Spectral graph theory
        - Graph-based PDEs

    Example:
        >>> network = NetworkGeometry(adjacency_matrix=A)
        >>> L = network.get_graph_laplacian_operator(normalized=False)

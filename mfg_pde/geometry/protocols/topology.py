"""
Topology trait protocols for geometry capabilities.

This module defines Protocol classes for topological geometry properties.
Geometries implement these protocols to advertise their topological structure:
- Manifold structure (smooth differential geometry)
- Lipschitz continuity (boundary regularity for well-posedness)
- Periodic topology (toroidal domains)

These protocols enable:
- Riemannian MFG on manifolds (geodesic Hamiltonians)
- Well-posedness validation (GKS/Lopatinskii-Shapiro conditions)
- Periodic BC automation (wrap-around connectivity)

Example:
    # Check if geometry is periodic
    if isinstance(geometry, SupportsPeriodic):
        periods = geometry.get_periods()
        wrapped_points = geometry.wrap_coordinates(points)

    # For manifold MFG
    if isinstance(geometry, SupportsManifold):
        metric = geometry.get_metric_tensor(points)
        # Use metric for geodesic Hamiltonian

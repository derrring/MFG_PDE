"""
Signed Distance Function (SDF) Utilities for MFG Computations.

This module provides convenient utility functions for computing signed distance
functions (SDFs) to common geometric primitives. These are commonly needed in:
- Obstacle avoidance problems
- Constrained MFG domains
- Boundary condition specification
- Visualization and level set methods

The utilities wrap the full `mfg_pde.geometry.implicit` infrastructure with
simpler function-based APIs for quick prototyping.

Key Functions:
- sdf_sphere: Distance to sphere/ball
- sdf_box: Distance to axis-aligned box
- sdf_union: Minimum of multiple SDFs (union)
- sdf_intersection: Maximum of multiple SDFs (intersection)
- sdf_complement: Negation of SDF (complement)
- sdf_difference: Difference of two SDFs

Use Cases:
- Quick obstacle specification in research code
- Initialization of level set methods
- Boundary proximity calculations
- Visualization of implicit boundaries

Examples:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from mfg_pde.utils.numerical import sdf_sphere, sdf_box
    >>>
    >>> # Distance to unit sphere centered at origin
    >>> points = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 0]])
    >>> dist = sdf_sphere(points, center=[0, 0], radius=1.0)
    >>> # [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0] (inside, on boundary, outside)
    >>>
    >>> # Distance to unit box
    >>> dist_box = sdf_box(points, bounds=[[-1, 1], [-1, 1]])

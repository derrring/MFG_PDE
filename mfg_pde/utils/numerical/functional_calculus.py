Functional calculus utilities for Master Equation formulations.

This module provides tools for computing functional derivatives in the Master Equation
formulation of Mean Field Games, where the value function lives on measure space:

    U: [0,T] × ℝ^d × P(ℝ^d) → ℝ

Mathematical Background:
    The Master Equation is a PDE on the space of probability measures:

    ∂U/∂t + H(x, ∇_x U, δU/δm, m) + (σ²/2) Δ_x U + ∫ L[δU/δm](x,y) m(dy) = 0

    where:
    - U(t,x,m): Value function at time t, position x, given measure m
    - δU/δm: First-order functional derivative (linear derivative)
    - L: Lift operator acting on functional derivative
    - ∇_x U: Spatial gradient
    - Δ_x U: Spatial Laplacian

Functional Derivatives:
    First-Order (Linear Derivative):
        δU/δm[m](x,y) = lim_{ε→0} (U[m + εδ_y] - U[m]) / ε

    Second-Order:
        δ²U/δm²[m](x,y,z) = lim_{ε→0} (δU/δm[m + εδ_z](x,y) - δU/δm[m](x,y)) / ε

Approximation Methods:
    1. Finite Differences: δU/δm ≈ (U[m + εδ_y] - U[m]) / ε
    2. Particle Approximation: m ≈ (1/N)Σᵢ δ_{yᵢ}, represent m by particles
    3. Automatic Differentiation: Use JAX/PyTorch for exact gradients

"""
Penalty method for variational inequality HJB (optimal stopping / entry-exit).

Solves: min(-du/dt + H(x, m, Du), v - Psi(x)) = 0

via penalization: -du/dt + H(x, m, Du) + (1/eps) * max(0, Psi(x) - v) = 0

This is a **wrapper** that decorates any BaseHJBSolver. The penalty term is
injected via the source_term parameter (#921), so the inner solver doesn't
need any modification. Any HJB solver (FDM, SL, GFDM, FEM) gains VI
capability instantly.

Issue #924: Part of Layer 1 (Generalized PDE & Institutional MFG Plan).

Mathematical background:
    The variational inequality arises in MFG with optimal stopping
    (entry/exit dynamics). Agents can choose to exit the game when their
    value function hits the obstacle Psi(x) (e.g., zero scrap value).

    The penalty method approximates the VI by adding a large penalty
    (1/eps) * max(0, Psi - v) to the HJB equation. As eps -> 0, the
    penalized solution converges to the VI solution.

    For MFG entry/exit models (Institutional Proposal Project A):
    - Psi(x) = 0 (exit value) with smooth pasting at the free boundary
    - The free boundary x*(t) separates active from exited firms

    Parameters
    ----------
    inner_solver : BaseHJBSolver
        The HJB solver to wrap. Can be any concrete solver (FDM, SL, GFDM, etc.)
    obstacle : Callable[[NDArray], NDArray]
        Obstacle function Psi(x). Receives spatial grid (N, d) or (N,),
        returns array of obstacle values (N,).
    penalty_parameter : float
        Penalty strength 1/eps. Larger values give sharper enforcement
        but may cause numerical stiffness. Default: 1e4.
        Typical range: 1e3 (soft) to 1e6 (hard).

"""
Model and Conditions classes for MFGArchon API v1.0.

These dataclasses separate the mathematical description of an MFG problem
into orthogonal components:

- Model: Game rules (Hamiltonian/Lagrangian + diffusion + coupling)
- Conditions: Problem data (time horizon + initial/terminal conditions)

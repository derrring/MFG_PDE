# El Farol Bar Problem - MFG Implementation

## Overview

This directory contains implementations of the famous **El Farol Bar Problem** (also known as the Santa Fe Bar Problem) using the MFG_PDE framework. The El Farol Bar Problem is a classic example in game theory and bounded rationality that demonstrates how individual rational decisions can lead to suboptimal collective outcomes.

## Problem Description

**The Setup:**
- N agents must independently decide whether to go to a bar
- The bar has limited capacity (e.g., comfortable for 60% of the population)
- If too many people go ‚Üí overcrowded, unpleasant experience (low utility)
- If few people go ‚Üí pleasant, uncrowded experience (high utility)
- Each agent tries to predict others' behavior and decides accordingly
- This creates a self-referential prediction problem

**The Challenge:**
- If everyone thinks "others won't go, so I should go" ‚Üí overcrowding
- If everyone thinks "others will go, so I shouldn't" ‚Üí underutilization
- The optimal solution requires coordination without communication

## MFG Formulation

We model this as a Mean Field Game where:

### State and Control Variables

- **State space**: $x \in [0,1]$ represents an agent's tendency to attend the bar
  - $x = 0$: Strong tendency to stay home  
  - $x = 1$: Strong tendency to attend bar

- **Population density**: $m(t,x)$ describes the distribution of agents over decision tendencies
  $$\int_0^1 m(t,x) \, dx = 1, \quad m(t,x) \geq 0$$

- **Control variable**: $u(t,x) \in \mathbb{R}$ is the rate of changing decision tendency

- **Expected attendance**: The fraction of population expected to attend
  $$A(t) = \int_0^1 x \cdot m(t,x) \, dx$$

### Dynamics and Cost Structure

- **State dynamics**: $dx_t = u_t \, dt + \sigma \, dW_t$ where $\sigma > 0$ is decision volatility

- **Population evolution** (Fokker-Planck equation):
  $$\frac{\partial m}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[u(t,x) m(t,x)] + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{\partial^2 m}{\partial x^2}$$

- **Running cost function**: 
  $$L(t, x, u, m) = \alpha \max(0, A(t) - \bar{C})^2 + \frac{1}{2} u^2 + \beta (x - x_{\text{hist}})^2$$
  
  where:
  - $\alpha > 0$ is the crowd aversion parameter
  - $\bar{C} \in (0,1)$ is the normalized bar capacity  
  - $\beta > 0$ weights historical memory
  - $x_{\text{hist}}$ represents historical attendance patterns

```

## Parameter Effects

### Bar Capacity
- **Lower capacity** ‚Üí More likely to be overcrowded
- **Higher capacity** ‚Üí More forgiving, better coordination

### Crowd Aversion
- **Low aversion** ‚Üí Risk of overcrowding
- **High aversion** ‚Üí Risk of underutilization  
- **Moderate aversion** ‚Üí Often optimal balance

### Decision Volatility
- **Low volatility** ‚Üí Agents stick to decisions (can cause herding)
- **High volatility** ‚Üí More exploration but less stable

## Mathematical Foundation

### Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Formulation

The **value function** $U(t,x)$ satisfies the HJB equation:
$$-\frac{\partial U}{\partial t} = \min_{u \in \mathbb{R}} \left[ L(t,x,u,m) + u \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^2} \right]$$

### Hamiltonian and Optimal Control

The **Hamiltonian** is defined as:
$$H(t,x,p,m) = \min_{u \in \mathbb{R}} \left[ L(t,x,u,m) + p \cdot u \right]$$

where $p = \frac{\partial U}{\partial x}$ is the costate variable.

The **optimal control** from the first-order condition:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial u} + p = 0 \Rightarrow u^*(t,x) = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}$$

### MFG Equilibrium System

An MFG equilibrium $(U^*, m^*)$ satisfies the coupled PDE system:

**Forward (Fokker-Planck):**
$$\frac{\partial m^*}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ \frac{\partial U^*}{\partial x} m^* \right] + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{\partial^2 m^*}{\partial x^2}$$

**Backward (HJB):**
$$-\frac{\partial U^*}{\partial t} = H\left(t,x,\frac{\partial U^*}{\partial x}, m^*\right) + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{\partial^2 U^*}{\partial x^2}$$

### Economic Efficiency Measure

**Efficiency** is quantified as:
$$\text{Efficiency} = 1 - \frac{|A^* - \bar{C}|}{\bar{C}} \in [0,1]$$

where $A^* = \lim_{t \to T} \int_0^1 x \cdot m^*(t,x) \, dx$ is the equilibrium attendance rate.

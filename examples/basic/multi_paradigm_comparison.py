Multi-Paradigm Comparison Example - DEPRECATED

WARNING: This example has been deprecated because it depends on ParticleCollocationSolver,
which has been moved to the mfg-research repository as part of architectural separation.

For particle-collocation examples, see: mfg-research/algorithms/particle_collocation/
For MFG_PDE examples using fixed-point solvers, see: examples/basic/lq_mfg_demo.py

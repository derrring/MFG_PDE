Capacity-constrained MFG for maze navigation and crowd dynamics.

This example demonstrates how to extend the MFG_PDE framework with application-specific
capacity constraints for modeling congestion effects in maze environments.

Key Components:
    - CapacityField: Spatially-varying capacity C(x) from maze geometry
    - CongestionModel: Convex cost functions g(ρ) with derivatives
    - CapacityConstrainedMFGProblem: MFG problem with congestion term

Mathematical Framework:
    The Hamiltonian is extended with a congestion cost term:

    H(x, m, ∇u) = (1/2)|∇u|² + α·m + γ·g(m(x)/C(x))

    where m(x)/C(x) is the congestion ratio and g() is a convex penalty function.
    As density approaches capacity, the cost g(m/C) → ∞ creates a "soft wall" effect.

Examples:
    >>> from examples.advanced.maze_navigation_capacity import (
    ...     CapacityField,
    ...     QuadraticCongestion,
    ...     CapacityConstrainedMFGProblem
    ... )
    >>> from mfg_pde.geometry.graph import PerfectMazeGenerator, MazeConfig
    >>>
    >>> # Generate maze
    >>> config = MazeConfig(rows=20, cols=20, wall_thickness=3)
    >>> maze = PerfectMazeGenerator.generate(config)
    >>> maze_array = maze.to_numpy_array()
    >>>
    >>> # Compute capacity field
    >>> capacity = CapacityField.from_maze_geometry(maze_array)
    >>>
    >>> # Create capacity-constrained problem
    >>> problem = CapacityConstrainedMFGProblem(
    ...     capacity_field=capacity,
    ...     congestion_model=QuadraticCongestion(),
    ...     congestion_weight=1.0,
    ...     spatial_bounds=[(0, 1), (0, 1)],
    ...     spatial_discretization=[63, 63],
    ...     T=1.0,
    ...     Nt=50,
    ...     sigma=0.01,
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Solve with any MFG solver
    >>> from mfg_pde.factory import create_fast_solver
    >>> solver = create_fast_solver(problem)
    >>> result = solver.solve()

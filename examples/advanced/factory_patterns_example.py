Factory Patterns Example - DEPRECATED

WARNING: This example has been deprecated because it uses create_monitored_solver
and ParticleCollocationSolver, which have been moved to the mfg-research repository.

For particle-collocation examples, see: mfg-research/algorithms/particle_collocation/
For MFG_PDE factory examples using fixed-point solvers, see: examples/basic/

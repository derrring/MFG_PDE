# MFG Solver Comparison Benchmarks

This directory contains comprehensive comparisons of different **base MFG solution methods** to evaluate their relative strengths, computational efficiency, and solution quality.

## üéØ **Purpose**

Compare and validate different MFG solving approaches to:
- Establish performance baselines for each method
- Understand method-specific strengths and limitations  
- Guide solver selection for different problem types
- Inform AMR enhancement strategy (see `../amr_evaluation/`)

## üßÆ **Solver Methods Evaluated**

### **1. Pure Finite Difference Method (FDM)**
- **Approach**: Classical FDM for both HJB and Fokker-Planck equations
- **Strengths**: Fast, well-established, simple implementation
- **Limitations**: Fixed resolution, no adaptivity

### **2. Hybrid Particle-FDM**  
- **Approach**: Particle methods for Fokker-Planck + FDM for HJB
- **Strengths**: Balanced performance, good mass conservation
- **Use Case**: General-purpose MFG solving

### **3. QP-Constrained Collocation**
- **Approach**: Constrained optimization with monotonicity preservation
- **Strengths**: Highest accuracy, superior boundary handling
- **Optimization**: Achieved 3.7% QP usage rate (97% acceleration)

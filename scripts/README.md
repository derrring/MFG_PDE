## Legacy Environment Management

### `manage_environments.sh`
Multi-environment management script for conda environments.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Create development environment
./scripts/manage_environments.sh create-dev

# Create performance-optimized environment
./scripts/manage_environments.sh create-performance

# Verify all environments
./scripts/manage_environments.sh verify

```

## Quick Start Guide

For new developers:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd MFG_PDE

# 2. Run modern setup (handles everything)
./scripts/setup_development.sh

# 3. Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# 4. Quick verification
python scripts/quick_type_check.py

# 5. Start developing! ðŸš€
```

## Development Guidelines

- All scripts should be executable (`chmod +x`)
- Include usage documentation in script headers
- Use consistent error handling and logging
- Test scripts in clean environments before committing
- Prefer UV-based workflows for performance when available

## Script Maintenance

Scripts are maintained alongside the main codebase. Update documentation when adding new scripts or modifying existing functionality.

**Recent Updates:**
- âœ… Added modern UV-based development setup
- âœ… Added rapid type checking workflow
- âœ… Enhanced verification capabilities

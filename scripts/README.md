## Quick Start Guide

For new developers:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd MFG_PDE

# 2. Run modern setup (handles everything)
./scripts/setup_development.sh

# 3. Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# 4. Quick verification
python scripts/quick_type_check.py

# 5. Start developing! 🚀
```

## Development Guidelines

- All scripts should be executable (`chmod +x`)
- Include usage documentation in script headers
- Use consistent error handling and logging
- Test scripts in clean environments before committing
- Prefer UV-based workflows for performance when available

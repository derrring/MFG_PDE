# Deprecated Algorithm Structure v1.0

**Status**: ✅ **ARCHIVED - MIGRATION COMPLETE**
**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Replacement**: `mfg_pde/alg/` (paradigm-based structure)

## Overview

This directory contains the original equation-based algorithm structure that was used in MFG_PDE prior to the paradigm-based reorganization completed in September 2025.

## Original Structure (DEPRECATED)

```
alg_old/                  # Original equation-based structure
├── hjb_solvers/          # ✅ Migrated to numerical/hjb_solvers/
├── fp_solvers/           # ✅ Migrated to numerical/fp_solvers/
├── mfg_solvers/          # ✅ Migrated to numerical/mfg_solvers/
├── variational_solvers/  # ✅ Migrated to optimization/variational_solvers/
└── neural_solvers/       # ✅ Migrated to neural/pinn_solvers/ + neural/core/
```

## Migration Summary ✅ COMPLETED

### **Perfect Migration Achievement**
- **Total Files Migrated**: 28/28 algorithm files (100% success)
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing code continues to work
- **Paradigms Created**: 3 complete mathematical paradigms
- **Architecture**: Production-ready multi-paradigm framework

### **New Paradigm-Based Structure**
```
mfg_pde/alg/             # ✅ NEW - Paradigm-based structure
├── numerical/           # Classical numerical analysis methods (16 algorithms)
├── optimization/        # Direct optimization approaches (3 algorithms)
└── neural/              # Neural network-based methods (9 files)
```

## Legacy Code Status

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This directory is provided for historical reference only.

- **❌ DO NOT USE**: This structure is fully deprecated
- **✅ USE INSTEAD**: `mfg_pde/alg/` paradigm-based structure
- **🔄 BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: Old import paths still work with deprecation warnings
- **📚 REFERENCE**: Keep for understanding migration history

## Migration Details

### **Successful Migrations**
- **HJB Solvers**: 5 solvers → `numerical/hjb_solvers/`
- **FP Solvers**: 4 solvers → `numerical/fp_solvers/`
- **MFG Solvers**: 7 solvers → `numerical/mfg_solvers/`
- **Variational Solvers**: 3 solvers → `optimization/variational_solvers/`
- **Neural Solvers**: 9 files → `neural/pinn_solvers/` + `neural/core/`

### **Architecture Benefits Achieved**
- **Conceptual Clarity**: Clear mathematical paradigm separation
- **Discoverability**: Researchers find methods by mathematical approach
- **Extensibility**: Ready for advanced neural methods (DGM, FNO, DeepONet)
- **Cross-Paradigm**: Enables hybrid method development

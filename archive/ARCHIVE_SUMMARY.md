# MFG_PDE Archive Summary

**Date**: July 25, 2025 (Updated: July 31, 2025)  
**Purpose**: Documentation of archived files after comprehensive refactoring completion

## üìã Archive Overview

This directory contains files that have been archived after the completion of the MFG_PDE comprehensive refactoring. All files here were either:

- Superseded by the new factory pattern system
- Old debugging/experimental scripts no longer needed
- Temporary analysis files that served their purpose
- Documentation that has been replaced by modern equivalents

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Archive Management Policy (Updated July 31, 2025)**

**New Archiving Strategy**:
- **Most obsolete files should be DELETED**, not archived
- **Only preserve code with genuine historical/educational value**
- **Generated outputs, temporary scripts, and clutter should be removed completely**
- **Focus on quality over quantity**: Better fewer meaningful examples than many obsolete ones

**Future Cleanup**: Many files in this archive could be safely deleted as they represent:
- Temporary debugging scripts with no ongoing value
- Generated analysis outputs that can be recreated
- Duplicate or superseded implementations
- Development artifacts with no historical significance

## üéØ Benefits of Archiving

1. **Cleaner Repository Structure**: Removed 40+ obsolete files
2. **Easier Navigation**: Clear separation between active and historical files
3. **Preserved History**: All files are preserved for reference but organized
4. **Modern Focus**: Repository now clearly showcases the modern factory pattern architecture
5. **Reduced Confusion**: New contributors won't be confused by obsolete examples

## üìù Notes for Future Reference

- All archived files are fully functional but superseded by modern equivalents
- The modern factory pattern system provides the same functionality with better architecture
- Analysis results from archived tests informed the final solver implementations
- Development documentation in archive tracks the evolution of the refactoring process

## üîÑ Recovery Instructions

If any archived file needs to be recovered:

1. **For Examples**: Copy from `archive/old_examples/` to `examples/` and update to use factory patterns
2. **For Tests**: Copy from `archive/superseded_tests/` and modernize with factory patterns
3. **For Documentation**: Reference archived docs but prefer creating new modern documentation

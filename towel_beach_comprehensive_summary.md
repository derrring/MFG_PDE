# Towel on Beach: Comprehensive Analysis Summary

## Figure Analysis Results

### Figure 1: 3D Evolution Analysis
- **Key Finding**: Demonstrates that λ controls final equilibrium pattern while m₀ only affects transient dynamics
- **Observation**: All 3D surfaces converge to same height distribution regardless of starting shape
- **Critical Insight**: Red line (stall position evolution) shows how density at amenity location depends on crowd aversion

### Figure 2: Final Density Convergence
- **Convergence Verification**: Maximum difference between final densities < 10⁻⁶ for all λ values
- **Pattern Classification**:
  - λ = 0.8: Single peak equilibrium (weak crowd aversion)
  - λ = 1.5: Mixed spatial pattern (balanced trade-off)
  - λ = 2.5: Crater pattern (strong crowd avoidance)
- **MFG Property**: Demonstrates uniqueness of equilibria in Mean Field Games

### Figure 3: Contour Evolution Dynamics
- **Temporal Analysis**: Shows smooth evolution from uniform initial state to structured equilibrium
- **Parameter Effect**: Higher λ creates more complex spatial patterns with density valleys
- **Convergence Speed**: All systems reach equilibrium within T = 2.0 time units

## Mathematical Significance

### Running Cost Decomposition
L(x,u,m) = |x - x_stall| + λ·ln(m) + ½u²

1. **Proximity Term**: |x - x_stall| creates attraction to amenity
2. **Congestion Term**: λ·ln(m) creates repulsion from crowds  
3. **Movement Cost**: ½u² penalizes rapid movement
4. **Parameter λ**: Controls attraction/repulsion balance

### Equilibrium Transitions
- **λ < 1.0**: Proximity dominates → Single peak at stall
- **1.0 < λ < 2.0**: Balanced competition → Mixed patterns  
- **λ > 2.0**: Congestion dominates → Crater formation

### Mean Field Game Properties
1. **Uniqueness**: Same λ always produces same equilibrium
2. **Stability**: Small perturbations in m₀ decay exponentially
3. **Optimality**: Each agent follows individually optimal strategy
4. **Emergence**: Individual optimization creates collective patterns

## Practical Applications

### Urban Planning
- Central amenities without congestion management create "craters" of unlivability
- Optimal placement considers both accessibility and crowd distribution
- Multiple service points can achieve desired spatial distributions

### Business Strategy  
- "Obvious" locations may be suboptimal due to oversaturation
- Adjacent-to-popular locations can capture crowd-averse customers
- Market positioning should consider competitor density effects

### Infrastructure Design
- Service distribution should account for user crowd preferences
- Capacity planning must consider spatial sorting effects
- Accessibility vs. congestion trade-offs are fundamental

## Research Extensions

### Theoretical Directions
1. **Multi-dimensional spaces**: 2D beaches with complex geometries
2. **Heterogeneous agents**: Different crowd aversion parameters λᵢ
3. **Dynamic amenities**: Time-varying or moving attraction points
4. **Network effects**: Social influences on location choice

### Computational Advances
1. **Adaptive meshing**: Efficient crater pattern resolution
2. **Machine learning**: Neural network policy approximation  
3. **Real-time algorithms**: Online equilibrium computation
4. **Stochastic optimization**: Robust parameter estimation

## Key Insights for Practitioners

1. **λ Parameter is Critical**: Small changes in crowd aversion can cause qualitative shifts in spatial patterns
2. **Initial Conditions Don't Matter**: Long-term spatial organization is independent of starting distribution
3. **Attraction-Repulsion Balance**: Successful spatial design requires managing both proximity benefits and congestion costs
4. **Emergence Principle**: Individual rational behavior creates predictable collective patterns

## Model Validation Considerations

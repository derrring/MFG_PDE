## Archive Contents

This directory contains historical phase-by-phase documentation for Track B development. These documents are preserved for reference but superseded by the consolidated completion summary.

### Phase 1: GPU-Accelerated KDE
**Location**: `phase1/`
- Initial analysis and design
- Benchmark results (3.74x speedup)
- Completion summaries

**Key Achievement**: Replaced scipy.stats.gaussian_kde with GPU implementation

### Phase 2: Full GPU Pipeline
**Location**: `phase2/`
- Design document
- Implementation summary
- Pipeline architecture

**Initial Result**: 0.14x (slower due to KDE transfers)

### Phase 2.1: Internal GPU KDE
**Location**: `phase2.1/`
- Performance analysis
- Transfer elimination design
- Final benchmark results

**Final Achievement**: 1.83x speedup (13x improvement over Phase 2)

## Why Archived?

These documents represent the development process but contain redundant information. The consolidated summary (`TRACK_B_GPU_ACCELERATION_COMPLETE.md`) provides:
- Complete overview of all three phases
- Final performance results
- Lessons learned
- Usage guidelines
- Future work recommendations

**Use These When**:
- Understanding the development process
- Learning from iteration and evolution
- Seeing how initial approaches were refined

**Use Main Doc When**:
- Understanding final implementation
- Getting performance benchmarks
- Using the GPU-accelerated solvers

# Archived BC Documentation (2025-12-16)

These documents were consolidated into a single canonical reference:

**New Location**: `docs/theory/BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS_REFERENCE.md`

## Archived Files

| File | Original Location | Reason |
|:-----|:------------------|:-------|
| `boundary_conditions_and_geometry.md` | `docs/theory/` | Merged into consolidated reference |
| `BC_UNIFICATION_TECHNICAL_REPORT.md` | `docs/development/reports/` | Merged into consolidated reference |
| `GEOMETRY_DOMAIN_BC_ARCHITECTURE.md` | `docs/development/guides/` | Merged into consolidated reference |

## Why Consolidated?

The three documents covered overlapping topics with different focuses:
- Theory doc: User-facing algorithm selection guide
- Technical report: Developer audit and implementation plan
- Architecture guide: System design overview

The new `BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS_REFERENCE.md` combines all content into a single authoritative source covering:
- Architecture and design principles
- All BC types with mathematical formulation
- All geometry types and method selection
- All applicators (FDM, FEM, Meshfree, Graph)
- Solver integration status and issues
- Numerical considerations (corners, order, performance)
- Future plans and implementation checklist
- Complete code reference

## Retrieval

If you need the original documents for historical reference, they are preserved here unchanged.

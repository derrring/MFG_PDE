## 🎯 **Naming Convention Standards Applied**

### **Status Prefixes Used**:
- `✅ [COMPLETED]` - Finished development work
- `✅ [RESOLVED]` - Closed issues and fixes
- `📋 [PLANNED]` - Future work with framework complete
- `🔄 [WIP]` - Work in progress
- `📚 [ARCHIVED]` - Historical content

### **Title Status Indicators**:
- `✅ COMPLETED` - Major milestones and implementations
- Status indicators in document headers with completion dates
- Dependencies and timeline information for planning documents

## 📚 **Documentation Categories by Status**

### **✅ Completed Work (10 documents)**
All major implementation work from 2025 properly documented and marked:
- Network MFG implementation complete with theoretical foundations
- Infrastructure improvements and refactoring completed  
- Visualization system enhancements completed
- Repository cleanup and maintenance standards established

### **📋 Planned Work (1 document)** 
Future development framework ready:
- Common noise and master equation MFG framework designed
- Implementation roadmap with clear dependencies and timeline

### **🔄 Active Documentation (1 document)**
Living documents updated with current status:
- Consolidated roadmap reflects completed milestones
- Network MFG implementation marked as completed phase

### **📚 Archived Content (1 document)**
Historical content properly preserved:
- Old roadmap archived with clear status indication

## 🛡️ **Quality Assurance Results**

### **Compliance Check**
- ✅ **All major implementations documented** with theoretical foundations
- ✅ **All completed work marked** with status indicators  
- ✅ **All resolved issues marked** with resolution status
- ✅ **All archived content marked** with archival status
- ✅ **Future work clearly indicated** with planning status
- ✅ **Dependencies tracked** between documents and implementations

### **Documentation Standards Met**
- ✅ **Mathematical formulations linked** to code implementations
- ✅ **Implementation summaries created** for major features
- ✅ **Theoretical documentation provided** for research-grade features
- ✅ **Status indicators in titles** and document headers
- ✅ **Proper naming conventions** with status prefixes
- ✅ **Cross-references maintained** between related documents

## 📈 **Benefits Achieved**

### **For Developers**
- **Clear status visibility**: Immediately see what's complete vs planned
- **Avoid duplicate work**: Completed items clearly marked
- **Focus on active work**: Active vs archived content clearly separated
- **Historical context**: Archived content preserved with clear marking

### **For Users/Researchers**
- **Implementation confidence**: Completed features clearly documented
- **Research foundations**: Theoretical documentation links to code
- **Future planning**: Planned features with clear timelines
- **Quality assurance**: Professional documentation standards

### **For Project Management**
- **Progress tracking**: Clear completion status across all documentation
- **Milestone visibility**: Major achievements properly documented
- **Dependency management**: Clear relationships between features
- **Quality metrics**: Documentation completeness and consistency

## 🔮 **Future Documentation Standards**

### **Mandatory Practices** (Now in CLAUDE.md)
1. **Status marking required** for all new documentation
2. **Title indicators mandatory** for major implementations  
3. **Filename prefixes required** for issues and completed work
4. **Cross-references maintained** between theory and implementation
5. **Completion dates documented** for all finished work

### **Templates Established**
- Implementation summaries with theoretical foundations
- Issue resolution documentation with clear status
- Planning documents with dependencies and timelines
- Archived content with historical context

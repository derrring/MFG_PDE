## Pre-Merge Checklist

✅ **All tests passing** (40/40)
```bash
$ pytest tests/unit/test_mean_field_*.py -v
========================= 40 passed in 1.42s =========================
```

✅ **Linting clean** (ruff)
✅ **Type checking clean** (mypy)
✅ **Examples work** (comparison demo runs successfully)
✅ **Documentation complete** (theory + implementation)
✅ **Working tree clean** (no uncommitted changes)
✅ **Remote up to date** (all commits pushed)

---

## Performance Validation

**Continuous LQ-MFG Benchmark** (500 episodes):
- TD3: -3.32 ± 0.21 (best performance)
- SAC: -3.50 ± 0.17 (robust exploration)
- DDPG: -4.28 ± 1.06 (fast learning)

All algorithms successfully solve the MFG problem.

## Post-Merge Actions

1. **Verify merge**: Check that main has all 5 commits
2. **Close issue**: Issue #61 should auto-close
3. **Update roadmap**: Mark Phase 3.3 complete in `STRATEGIC_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP_2026.md`
4. **Tag release**: Create v1.4.0 tag
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.4.0 -m "Release v1.4.0: Continuous Actions Complete"
   git push origin v1.4.0
   ```
5. **Update documentation**: Add continuous action examples to user guide
6. **Announce**: Share on project channels/discussions

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Level: **LOW** ✅

**Why low risk:**
- ✅ Pure addition (no deletions, no breaking changes)
- ✅ All tests passing (100% pass rate)
- ✅ No changes to existing algorithms
- ✅ Fully documented
- ✅ Working examples provided
- ✅ Independent feature (doesn't modify core)

**No breaking changes**: Existing code remains unchanged. New algorithms are additive.

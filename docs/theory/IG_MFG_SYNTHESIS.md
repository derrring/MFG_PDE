## Core Thesis

**The fundamental insight**: Applying information geometry to mean field games transforms the analytical PDE framework into a **geometric dynamical system** where the state of the entire multi-agent population is a single point on a manifold, and its evolution is governed by geometric principles (geodesics, gradient flows).

This is not merely a notational convenience—it is a **conceptual paradigm shift** that:
1. Unifies MFGs with optimal transport, statistical physics, and machine learning
2. Reveals that the choice of geometry encodes fundamental modeling assumptions
3. Provides new computational methods and theoretical insights

## I. The Conceptual Shift: From PDEs to Geometric Trajectories

### Traditional MFG View (Analytical)

**State**: Population distribution $m(t,x)$ evolves according to Fokker-Planck equation
**Equilibrium**: Solution to coupled HJB-FPK system
**Analysis**: PDE theory, regularity, uniqueness

### Geometric View

**State**: Point $m(t) \in \mathcal{P}(M)$ on the manifold of probability measures
**Evolution**: Trajectory (curve) on this manifold
**Equilibrium**: Fixed point of geometric flow

**Geometric Questions**:
- What is the "length" of the path from $m_0$ to $m_T$?
- Is the system following a geodesic (shortest path)?
- Is it a gradient flow (steepest descent)?
- What is the curvature of the space?

**Answer Depends on Geometry**: The answers are **not intrinsic to the problem** but depend on the choice of metric on $\mathcal{P}(M)$.

## II. Geometry as Modeling Axiom

The choice of metric on $\mathcal{P}(M)$ is a **fundamental modeling decision** that encodes assumptions about the "physics" of agent interactions.

### Three Canonical Geometries

#### 1. Wasserstein Geometry (Transport-Based)

**Metric**: Wasserstein-2 distance $W_2(\mu, \nu)$
$$W_2^2(\mu, \nu) = \inf_{\pi \in \Pi(\mu,\nu)} \int |x-y|^2 \, \pi(dx,dy)$$

**Physical Meaning**: Cost of transporting mass from distribution $\mu$ to $\nu$

**Tangent Vectors**: Velocity fields $v$ such that $\partial_t m + \nabla \cdot (m v) = 0$

**Gradient Flow**: Fokker-Planck equation is Wasserstein gradient flow of relative entropy
$$\frac{\partial m}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (m \nabla V) + \epsilon \Delta m = -\nabla_{W_2} \mathcal{E}[m]$$

**MFG Applications**:
- Congestion games (agent movement through space)
- Traffic flow, crowd dynamics
- Spatial resource allocation
- Any system where agents physically move

**Key Property**: Mass conservation (balanced transport)

#### 2. Fisher-Rao Geometry (Reaction-Based)

**Metric**: Rao distance (Hellinger metric)
$$d_{FR}^2(\mu, \nu) = 4 \arccos^2\left(\int \sqrt{m(x)n(x)} \, dx\right)$$

**Physical Meaning**: Statistical distinguishability; cost of "birth/death" of mass

**Tangent Vectors**: Functions $\xi$ with $\int \xi = 0$ and finite Fisher norm

**Gradient Flow**: Replicator equation in evolutionary game theory
$$\frac{\partial m}{\partial t} = m(\bar{V} - V)$$

**MFG Applications**:
- Evolutionary games (strategy adoption)
- Entry/exit games (agents appear/disappear)
- Opinion dynamics (discrete choice models)
- Any system where location is irrelevant but proportions matter

**Key Property**: Preserves total mass but allows local creation/destruction

#### 3. Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao Geometry (Hybrid)

**Metric**: WFR distance interpolating between transport and reaction
$$\text{WFR}^2(\mu, \nu) = \inf \int_0^1 \int (|v|^2 + |g|^2) \rho \, dx \, dt$$

**Physical Meaning**: Optimal combination of moving mass ($v$) and creating/destroying it ($g$)

**Continuity Equation**: Generalized with source term
$$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho v) = \rho g$$

**Gradient Flow**: Combines diffusion (Wasserstein) and replicator (Fisher-Rao)
$$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (\rho \nabla \frac{\delta \mathcal{E}}{\delta \rho}) + \rho \frac{\delta \mathcal{E}}{\delta \rho}$$

**MFG Applications**:
- **Open systems**: Population varies over time (firm entry/exit, epidemics)
- **Hybrid dynamics**: Agents both move and appear/disappear
- **Generative modeling**: GANs, diffusion models
- **Economic models**: Market dynamics with entry barriers

**Key Property**: Unbalanced transport (mass not conserved)

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | Wasserstein | Fisher-Rao | WFR |
|:-------|:------------|:-----------|:----|
| **Preserves** | Mass conservation | Total mass | Neither (general) |
| **Penalizes** | Spatial transport | Local creation/destruction | Both |
| **Geodesics** | Optimal transport maps | Statistical exponential families | Hybrid paths |
| **Physical Analog** | Fluid mechanics | Chemical reaction | Reaction-diffusion |
| **Curvature** | Non-positive (CAT(0)) | Non-negative | Variable |
| **Flatness** | Not flat (except Gaussian) | Flat for exponential families | Generally curved |

## III. Unifying Power: Connecting Disparate Fields

The IG+MFG framework provides a **common language** connecting:

### Statistical Physics → MFG
- Mean-field approximation (statistical mechanics) ≈ MFG limit ($N \to \infty$)
- Fokker-Planck equation ≈ Wasserstein gradient flow of free energy
- Partition function ≈ Value function in logarithmic MFG

### Optimal Transport → MFG
- Monge-Kantorovich problem ≈ Potential MFG with spatial constraints
- Benamou-Brenier formulation ≈ Dynamic formulation of MFG
- Displacement convexity ≈ Uniqueness of MFG equilibrium

### Machine Learning → MFG
- Policy gradient (RL) ≈ Natural gradient on policy manifold
- GAN training dynamics ≈ Zero-sum MFG
- Diffusion models ≈ WFR gradient flow with time-reversal

### Evolutionary Game Theory → MFG
- Replicator dynamics ≈ Fisher-Rao gradient flow
- Nash equilibrium selection ≈ Stable manifold in IG
- Mutation-selection balance ≈ WFR equilibrium

## IV. Theoretical Implications

### 1. Uniqueness and Stability of Equilibria

**Classical Condition** (Lasry-Lions): Monotonicity of Hamiltonian
$$H(x, p, \mu) - H(x, p, \nu) \text{ is monotone in } \mu$$

**Geometric Interpretation**:
- For Wasserstein: Displacement convexity of potential
- For Fisher-Rao: Geodesic convexity
- Curvature conditions ensure uniqueness

**Practical Use**: Check geometric properties to verify uniqueness

### 2. Convergence Rates

**Gradient Flow Convergence**: If $\mathcal{E}[m]$ is $\lambda$-convex:
$$\mathcal{E}[m_t] - \mathcal{E}[m_*] \leq e^{-\lambda t} (\mathcal{E}[m_0] - \mathcal{E}[m_*])$$

**Exponential Convergence**: Guaranteed for:
- Strongly convex potentials in Wasserstein geometry
- Exponential families in Fisher-Rao geometry

### 3. Master Equation as Infinite-Dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi

**Classical HJB**: On $\mathbb{R}^d$
$$-\partial_t u + H(x, \nabla u) = 0$$

**Master Equation**: On $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d)$
$$-\partial_t U + H_\infty(m, \nabla_m U) = 0$$

where $\nabla_m$ is the Lions derivative (functional gradient).

**Geometric Insight**: Master equation is Hamilton-Jacobi on Wasserstein manifold

## V. Computational Implications

### 1. Structure-Preserving Discretization

**Wasserstein Discretization**:
- Particle methods (Lagrangian)
- JKO scheme (implicit Euler on Wasserstein space)
- Guaranteed energy dissipation

**Fisher-Rao Discretization**:
- Exponential family approximation
- Natural gradient updates
- Preserves simplex constraints

### 2. Curse of Dimensionality

**Problem**: Traditional PDE solvers fail in high dimensions

**Geometric Solutions**:
- **Wasserstein**: Particle methods avoid grid (mesh-free)
- **Fisher-Rao**: Parametric approximation (exponential families)
- **Neural networks**: Learn geometric flow on manifold

### 3. Inverse Problems

**Forward Problem**: Given game rules → find equilibrium
**Inverse Problem**: Given observed dynamics → infer game structure

**Geometric Formulation**: Infer metric on $\mathcal{P}(M)$ from trajectories
- Maximum likelihood on statistical manifold
- Fisher information identifies geometry
- Applications: Econometrics, behavioral modeling

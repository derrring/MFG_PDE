# Private Theory Documentation

This directory contains **unpublished theoretical research** and **mathematical formulations** that should NOT be committed to public GitHub.

## What Goes Here

- 📐 **Unpublished Mathematical Theory**: Novel formulations before publication
- 🔬 **Research Papers (Draft)**: Theory documents for papers in preparation
- 📊 **Theoretical Analysis**: Mathematical derivations and proofs (internal)
- 🧮 **Novel Algorithms**: Mathematical foundations for proprietary methods

## Gitignore Status

These files are **excluded from git tracking** via:
```gitignore
docs/**/private/
```

## Current Contents

- `particle_collocation_qp_monotone.md` - Complete mathematical theory for QP-constrained monotone particle-collocation (15,000+ words)

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Keep it Private**: Mathematical formulations for unpublished research
2. **Reference Implementation**: Can link to public code implementations
3. **Publish When Ready**: Move to parent directory after paper submission/acceptance
4. **LaTeX Welcome**: Mathematical notation encouraged for clarity

## When to Move to Public

Move documents from `private/` to parent when:
- ✅ Paper is submitted or published
- ✅ Theory is presented at conferences
- ✅ Algorithm is open-sourced and documented
- ✅ Mathematical methods are ready for public use

**Directory Purpose**: Protect unpublished theoretical research
**Gitignored**: Yes (excluded from version control)

## üéØ Key Concepts

### Discrete vs Continuous Actions

**Discrete MFG-RL** (current stable implementation):
```python
Q(s, m) ‚Üí [Q(s,a‚ÇÅ,m), Q(s,a‚ÇÇ,m), ..., Q(s,a‚Çô,m)]  # Vector output
```
- ‚úÖ Works well for |A| ‚â§ 20
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenging for 20 < |A| ‚â§ 100
- ‚ùå Fails for |A| > 100 or continuous actions

**Continuous MFG-RL** (theoretical/under development):
```python
# Actor-Critic Architecture
actor: (s, m) ‚Üí a ‚àà ‚Ñù·µà                    # Deterministic policy
critic: (s, a, m) ‚Üí Q(s, a, m) ‚àà ‚Ñù        # Action as input
```
- ‚úÖ Handles $a \in \mathbb{R}^d$ (infinite action spaces)
- ‚úÖ Scales to high-dimensional actions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires new architectures (DDPG, TD3, SAC)

### Mean Field Reinforcement Learning Formulation

**Standard RL** + **Population State**:

**State Space**: Individual state $s \in \mathcal{S}$ + Population distribution $m \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S})$

**Key Equations**:
$$
\begin{align}
\text{HJB:} \quad & -\partial_t u + H(s, \nabla u, m) = f(s, m) \\
\text{FP:} \quad & \partial_t m - \Delta m - \nabla \cdot (m \nabla_p H) = 0 \\
\text{Optimal Policy:} \quad & a^*(s, m) = \arg\max_a \left\{ -\nabla u \cdot b(s,a,m) - L(s,a,m) \right\}
\end{align}
$$

**RL Objective**: Find policy $\pi(a|s,m)$ maximizing $J(\pi)$ where population $m = \mu(\pi)$ (consistency condition)

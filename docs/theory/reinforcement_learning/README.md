## üéØ Overview

This directory contains theoretical foundations for applying reinforcement learning to Mean Field Games, with particular focus on:

1. **Continuous Action Spaces**: Mathematical formulation and algorithmic approaches
2. **Scalability Analysis**: Computational complexity and feasibility of different action space types
3. **Architecture Patterns**: Network designs for continuous control in MFG settings

## üî¨ Key Concepts

### Discrete vs Continuous Actions

**Discrete MFG-RL** (current implementation):
- Q(s, a, m) ‚Üí [Q(s,a‚ÇÅ,m), ..., Q(s,a‚Çô,m)] (vector output)
- Works well for |A| ‚â§ 20
- Fails for |A| > 100 or continuous actions

**Continuous MFG-RL** (theoretical framework):
- Q(s, a, m) with action as INPUT (scalar output)
- Handles a ‚àà ‚Ñù·µà (infinite action spaces)
- Requires new architectures (DDPG, SAC, TD3)

### Mean Field Reinforcement Learning Formulation

**Standard RL** + **Population State**:
- State: s ‚àà S
- Action: a ‚àà A (discrete or continuous)
- Population: m ‚àà P(S) (distribution of agent states)
- Reward: r(s, a, m)
- Objective: Find œÄ(a|s, m) maximizing J(œÄ) where m = Œº(œÄ)

   - Wrapper pattern defined
   - Integration points identified

📋 Phase 3: Validation (Weeks 3-4)
   - Test framework ready
   - Benchmark infrastructure exists
   - Profiling tools operational

📋 Phase 4: 2D/3D Extension (Weeks 5-6)
   - Multi-dimensional infrastructure in place

   - Domain decomposition extends naturally
```

### Blockers for Phase 3
```
✅ NONE - All prerequisites satisfied
```

## ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

### Pytest Warnings
```
⚠️ 15 warnings in test suite:
   - PytestReturnNotNoneWarning (1 occurrence)
   - Minor deprecation warnings

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Before Starting Phase 3

**1. Nothing Required** ✅
   - Repository is in perfect state for Phase 3 development
   - All prerequisites are satisfied
   - No blockers or critical issues

**2. Optional Improvements** (Can be done during Phase 3):
   - Fix pytest warnings (low priority)
   - Complete paradigm documentation (Issues #103-105)
   - Install stable-baselines3 if needed for RL work

### Phase 3 Development Workflow

**1. Follow CLAUDE.md Principles**:
   - ✅ Issue-first workflow (create issue before work)
   - ✅ Proper branch naming (<type>/<description>)
   - ✅ Pre-commit hooks (already active)
   - ✅ Test before committing

**2. MPI Development Strategy**:
   - Start with Phase 1 (Domain Decomposition)
   - Follow the 6-week roadmap in MPI_INTEGRATION_TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md
   - Test incrementally (unit → integration → scaling)
   - Document as you go

**3. Quality Gates**:
   - ✅ All tests must pass (currently: 675/675)
   - ✅ Ruff checks must pass (currently: 0 errors)
   - ✅ CI must be green (currently: passing)
   - ✅ Documentation updated (pattern established)

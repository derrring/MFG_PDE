# Solo Maintainer's Self-Governance Protocol âœ… IMPLEMENTED

## Overview

As the primary maintainer of MFG_PDE, this protocol ensures disciplined, high-quality changes through structured decision-making and comprehensive quality gates.

## Protocol Workflow

### 1. **Propose in an Issue** ðŸ“‹
- **Purpose**: Create a "decision log" and force clear articulation of the problem
- **When**: For any significant change (refactoring, new features, architectural decisions)
- **Template**: Include problem statement, proposed solution, and success criteria

### 2. **Implement in a Feature Branch** ðŸ”§
- **Purpose**: Leverage automated CI checks as quality gates
- **Process**: All work done in feature branches, submitted via Pull Request
- **Benefits**: Triggers unified CI/CD pipeline for comprehensive validation

### 3. **Conduct AI-Assisted Review** ðŸ¤–
- **Purpose**: Get structured, objective review against established standards
- **Process**: Request formal review from AI assistant using code diffs
- **Standards**: Review against CLAUDE.md conventions and repository patterns

### 4. **Merge on Pass** âœ…
- **Criteria**: All automated checks pass + AI-assisted review complete
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs with outcome and decision rationale
- **Closure**: Link final documentation in Issue closure comment

## Quality Gates

### Automated Validation (CI/CD)
- âœ… Ruff formatting and linting
- âœ… Mypy type checking
- âœ… Performance regression tests
- âœ… Memory usage validation
- âœ… Security scanning (on releases)

### Manual Review Standards
- âœ… Code follows CLAUDE.md conventions
- âœ… Documentation is updated and complete
- âœ… Mathematical notation consistency
- âœ… Repository structure compliance
- âœ… Import patterns follow established conventions

## Benefits for Solo Development

1. **Disciplined Decision Making**: Issues force clear problem articulation
2. **Quality Assurance**: CI/CD prevents regressions automatically
3. **Historical Record**: Complete traceability from idea to implementation
4. **Structured Review**: AI assistant provides objective, standards-based feedback
5. **Perfect Memory**: Six months later, full context is recoverable

## Implementation Status

- âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline**: Unified workflow with smart triggering
- âœ… **Pre-commit Standards**: Mandatory Ruff tooling configuration
- âœ… **Documentation**: CONTRIBUTING.md updated with official procedures
- âœ… **Self-Governance**: Protocol documented and ready for use

## Example Usage

### Typical Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create GitHub Issue: "Implement adaptive mesh refinement"
# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/adaptive-mesh-refinement

# 3. Implement changes with automatic quality checks
git commit -m "Add AMR solver with error estimation"
# (pre-commit hooks run automatically)

# 4. Open Pull Request
# (CI/CD pipeline runs comprehensive validation)

# 5. Request AI review with diff
# 6. Merge after all checks pass
# 7. Update docs and close issue with reference
```

## Next Steps

This protocol is now operational and should be used for all significant changes to MFG_PDE. The next implementation task is to complete the remaining type modernization work using this structured approach.

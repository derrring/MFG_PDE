## üìã Design Philosophy

All design documents follow these principles:
1. **Mathematical Rigor**: Precise formulations with proper notation
2. **Implementation Clarity**: Clear path from theory to code
3. **Performance Awareness**: Computational complexity analysis
4. **Extensibility**: Design for future enhancements

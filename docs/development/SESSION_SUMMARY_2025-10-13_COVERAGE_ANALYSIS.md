## Implementation Strategy

### Testing Infrastructure

**Test Organization**:
```
tests/
├── unit/              # Fast, isolated unit tests
│   ├── algorithms/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── config/
├── integration/       # Slower integration tests
│   ├── solver_pipelines/
│   └── end_to_end/
├── benchmarks/        # Performance benchmarks
└── regression/        # Regression test suite
```

**CI/CD Integration**:
- Upload coverage to Codecov on every PR
- Require coverage not to decrease
- Generate HTML coverage reports for review
- Track coverage trends over time

### Testing Best Practices

**Unit Test Template**:
```python
import pytest
from mfg_pde.utils.cli import parse_args

class TestCLI:
    def test_basic_parsing(self):
        """Test CLI parses basic arguments correctly."""
        args = parse_args(['--solver', 'fixed_point'])
        assert args.solver == 'fixed_point'

    def test_invalid_solver(self):
        """Test CLI rejects invalid solver types."""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            parse_args(['--solver', 'nonexistent'])
```

**Coverage Measurement**:
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=mfg_pde --cov-report=term-missing tests/

# Generate HTML report
pytest --cov=mfg_pde --cov-report=html tests/

# Upload to Codecov (CI)
bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash)
```

## Known Limitations

### Neural Network Testing
**Challenge**: Neural solvers require GPU and long training times.
**Mitigation**: Test initialization and architecture only, skip convergence tests.

### Reinforcement Learning Testing
**Challenge**: RL training is stochastic and computationally expensive.
**Mitigation**: Test environment dynamics only, skip full training loops.

### Visualization Testing
**Challenge**: Plot generation requires display backend.
**Mitigation**: Use non-interactive backends (Agg), test data preparation.

### High-Dimensional Benchmarks
**Challenge**: Benchmarks require significant computational resources.
**Mitigation**: Test construction with small problems, skip full runs.

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Prioritize Critical Infrastructure First

**Rationale**:
- CLI and experiment management affect user experience directly
- Convergence analysis affects solver reliability
- These are production-critical components with low current coverage

**Impact**:
- Ensures most impactful improvements happen first
- Builds confidence in user-facing tools

### Decision 2: Defer Experimental Feature Testing

**Rationale**:
- Hooks system (0%, 968 lines) is experimental
- Meta-programming (0%, 746 lines) is advanced research feature
- RL module (0-15%) is research code, not production
- These features can be tested before promotion to stable API

**Impact**:
- Focuses resources on production code
- Allows experimental APIs to stabilize before testing

### Decision 3: Incremental 3-Phase Approach

**Rationale**:
- Breaking into phases provides clear milestones
- Allows validation at each phase before proceeding
- Easier to track progress and adjust priorities

**Impact**:
- 46% → 60% → 70% → 75% progression
- Each phase ~3 weeks, total 7-9 weeks

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Research Codebases Have Different Coverage Needs

**Observation**: 46% coverage is actually reasonable for research code with extensive experimental features.

**Takeaway**: Prioritize production-critical code over experimental features.

### 2. Coverage Analysis Reveals Architectural Insights

**Observation**:
- Core MFG functionality: 80-100% coverage
- Experimental features: 0-15% coverage
- User-facing tools: 8-10% coverage (surprisingly low)

**Takeaway**: User-facing tools need urgent attention despite being non-core.

### 3. Test Suite Performance is Excellent

**Observation**: 2,255 tests in 3.7 minutes = 0.1s per test average.

**Takeaway**: Fast test suite enables frequent coverage measurement.

### 4. Coverage Gaps Align with Development Priorities

**Observation**: Most 0% coverage modules are experimental research features.

**Takeaway**: Coverage reflects stability - stable APIs are well-tested.

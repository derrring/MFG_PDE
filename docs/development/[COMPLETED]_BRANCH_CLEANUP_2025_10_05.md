# Branch Cleanup Summary - 2025-10-05

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Impact**: 82% reduction in branch count

---

## Overview

Cleaned up stale git branches after successful PR merges. GitHub automatically deleted remote branches when PRs were merged, and this cleanup removed the local tracking references and obsolete local branches.

## Branches Cleaned Up

### Remote Branches (Auto-Deleted by GitHub)

All 11 branches were already deleted remotely when their PRs were merged:

| Branch | PR # | Merged Date |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| `chore/nomenclature-standard-solver` | #81 | 2025-10-05 |
| `fix/use-particle-fp-by-default` | #80 | 2025-10-05 |
| `fix/weno-test-updates` | #79 | 2025-10-05 |
| `fix/dgm-architecture-pytorch` | #78 | 2025-10-05 |
| `fix/boundary-condition-validation` | #77 | 2025-10-05 |
| `fix/solver-result-api-migration` | #75 | 2025-10-05 |
| `fix/test-import-error` | #74 | 2025-10-05 |
| `feature/phase2.2-documentation` | #73 | 2025-10-05 |
| `feature/phase2.2-analytical-validation` | #72 | 2025-10-05 |
| `fix/common-noise-imports` | #71 | 2025-10-05 |
| `feature/multi-population-continuous-control` | #70 | 2025-10-05 |

**Action Taken**: Pruned stale remote tracking references with `git fetch --prune`

### Local Branches Deleted

| Branch | Status | Last Commit |
|:-------|:-------|:------------|
| `feature/phase3-jax-backend` | ✅ Merged to main | d90b591 |
| `feature/phase3-tiered-backend` | ✅ Merged to main | d90b591 |
| `feature/phase3-torch-backend` | ✅ Merged to main | d5a5ac4 |
| `feature/stochastic-mfg-extensions` | ⚠️ Deleted local copy only | 90f5934 |

**Note**: The `stochastic-mfg-extensions` branch still exists remotely and contains WIP for Phase 2.2 (Issue #68).

## Before vs After

### Before Cleanup
```
Local Branches: 5
- main
- feature/phase3-jax-backend
- feature/phase3-tiered-backend
- feature/phase3-torch-backend
- feature/stochastic-mfg-extensions

Remote Branches: 13
- origin/main
- origin/HEAD
- origin/feature/stochastic-mfg-extensions
- [11 merged branches]
```

### After Cleanup
```
Local Branches: 1
- main

Remote Branches: 3
- origin/main
- origin/HEAD
- origin/feature/stochastic-mfg-extensions
```

**Total Reduction**: 17 branches → 3 branches **(82% reduction)** ✅

## Active Development Branch

### `feature/stochastic-mfg-extensions`

**Status**: WIP for Phase 2.2 (Issue #68)
**Location**: Remote only
**Last Activity**: 2025-10-04

**Contains**:
- Common noise MFG solver implementation
- Noise process library (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, GBM, CIR, Jump Diffusion)
- Functional calculus utilities for master equation
- Stochastic problem definitions
- Unit tests for functional calculus and noise processes

**Files Added/Modified**:
```

A  mfg_pde/alg/neural/stochastic/__init__.py

M  docs/development/PHASE_2.2_STOCHASTIC_MFG_PLAN.md
M  mfg_pde/alg/numerical/mfg_solvers/hybrid_fp_particle_hjb_fdm.py
```

**Future Action**: When resuming Phase 2.2 work (Issue #68):
1. Check if branch needs rebasing onto current main (likely yes, due to test suite fixes)
2. Review if implementation is still aligned with current architecture
3. Consider creating fresh branch if conflicts are significant
4. Preserve functional calculus and noise process implementations

---

## Commands Executed

```bash
# 1. Fetch and prune stale remote tracking branches
git fetch --prune

# 2. Delete merged local branches
git branch -d feature/phase3-jax-backend
git branch -d feature/phase3-tiered-backend
git branch -d feature/phase3-torch-backend

# 3. Delete local copy of stochastic branch (remote preserved)
git branch -D feature/stochastic-mfg-extensions
```

---

## Benefits

1. **✅ Cleaner Repository**
   - Easier to understand current development state
   - No confusion about which branches are active

2. **✅ Faster Git Operations**
   - Fewer branches to track and update
   - Reduced cognitive load when listing branches

3. **✅ Better Hygiene**
   - Following Git best practices
   - Removing merged branches prevents accumulation

4. **✅ Clear Development Path**
   - Only active work (`main` + `stochastic-mfg-extensions`) visible
   - Easy to see what's next (Phase 2.2 work)

## Lessons Learned

### GitHub Auto-Delete Setting

GitHub's "Automatically delete head branches" setting (enabled in repo settings) automatically deletes branches when PRs are merged. This is best practice and reduces manual cleanup.

**Recommendation**: Keep this setting enabled ✅

### Local Branch Management

Local branches should be deleted after merging to avoid:
- Confusion about branch status
- Accidental work on stale branches
- Git clutter

**Best Practice**: Delete local branches immediately after PR merge:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git branch -d <merged-branch>
```

### Long-Lived Feature Branches

The `stochastic-mfg-extensions` branch shows the challenge of long-lived feature branches:
- Main has evolved significantly (test suite fixes, deprecation cleanup)
- Branch may need significant rebasing
- Consider breaking into smaller, shorter-lived branches

**Recommendation**: For Phase 2.2, consider:
- Multiple smaller PRs instead of one large branch
- Weekly rebasing onto main to minimize conflicts
- Feature flags for incomplete work

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- ✅ Document this cleanup
- ✅ Update any references to deleted branches in docs

### When Resuming Phase 2.2 (Issue #68)
1. Checkout `origin/feature/stochastic-mfg-extensions`
2. Attempt rebase onto current `main`
3. Review conflicts (likely in test files due to recent fixes)
4. Update tests to use new conventions (np.trapezoid, max_newton_iterations, etc.)
5. Ensure all new code passes current test suite standards

---

## Conclusion

**Success**: ✅ Repository cleaned up from 17 branches to 3 branches

The branch cleanup makes the repository cleaner and easier to navigate. All merged work is safely integrated into `main`, and the only active feature branch (`stochastic-mfg-extensions`) is preserved remotely for future Phase 2.2 work.

This cleanup follows Git best practices and sets up better branch hygiene going forward.

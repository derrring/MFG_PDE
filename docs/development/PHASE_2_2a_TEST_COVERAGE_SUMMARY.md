# Phase 2.2a: Comprehensive Solver Unit Test Coverage - COMPLETE

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Branch**: `test/phase2-coverage-expansion` → merged to `main`
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview

Phase 2.2a successfully completed comprehensive unit test coverage for all major numerical solvers in the MFG_PDE package. This phase focused on creating thorough unit tests for HJB (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman) and FP (Fokker-Planck) solvers that were previously lacking dedicated unit test coverage.

## Completed Work Summary

### New Unit Test Files Created

| Test File | Lines | Tests | Coverage Areas |
|:----------|------:|------:|:--------------|
| `test_hjb_fdm_solver.py` | 375 | 20+ | FDM HJB solver with Newton iteration, deprecated parameters |
| `test_hjb_network_solver.py` | 536 | 30+ | Network HJB solver with 3 schemes (explicit/implicit/semi-implicit) |
| `test_weno_family.py` (expanded) | +170 | +11 | WENO HJB solver integration tests for `solve_hjb_system` |
| `test_fp_network_solver.py` | 652 | 27 | Network FP solver with mass conservation |
| `test_fp_particle_solver.py` | 564 | 36 | Particle FP solver with KDE normalization strategies |

**Total New/Expanded**: 5 files, **~2,300 lines**, **120+ tests**

### Existing Integration Test Review

Reviewed existing integration test suite:
- **102 integration tests** across 21 test files
- **83 passing** - Core integration tests working well
- **18 skipped** - Expected (GFDM tests, common noise tests awaiting implementation)
- **1 pre-existing failure** - Known numerical convergence issue in `test_mass_conservation_1d_simple.py`

## Technical Achievements

### 1. WENO Solver Critical Discovery

**Issue**: WENO solver uses different grid convention than other HJB solvers.

**Discovery**:
```python
# WENO solver at mfg_pde/alg/numerical/hjb_solvers/hjb_weno.py:571-575
U_solved = np.zeros((Nt + 1, Nx))  # Uses Nx, not Nx+1
```

**Impact**: All WENO integration tests required adjustment to use `Nx` instead of `Nx+1`.

**Documentation**: Added comments in all WENO tests: `# WENO uses Nx, not Nx+1`

### 2. Particle Solver Complexity Handling

**Challenge**: FPParticleSolver is the most complex solver with:
- Multiple KDE normalization strategies (NONE, INITIAL_ONLY, ALL)
- Deprecated parameter backward compatibility
- Strategy selector for intelligent CPU/GPU/Hybrid pipeline dispatch
- Stochastic behavior requiring appropriate test tolerances

**Solution**: Created 36 comprehensive tests covering:
- All three KDE normalization strategies
- Deprecated parameter warnings (`normalize_kde_output`, `normalize_only_initial`)
- Backend selection and strategy selector
- Stochastic behavior with relaxed tolerances

**Key Test Pattern**:
```python
def test_solve_fp_system_initial_condition(self):
    # KDE introduces smoothing - test center of mass instead of point-wise
    cm_initial = np.sum(x_coords * m_initial * problem.Dx)
    cm_solution = np.sum(x_coords * M_solution[0, :] * problem.Dx)
    assert np.isclose(cm_initial, cm_solution, rtol=0.2)
```

### 3. Network Solver Comprehensive Coverage

**Achievement**: Created complete test suites for network MFG solvers:
- `NetworkHJBSolver`: 30+ tests covering 3 time-stepping schemes
- `FPNetworkSolver`: 27 tests covering mass conservation and network geometries

**Coverage**:
- Initialization with custom parameters
- All time-stepping schemes (explicit, implicit, semi-implicit, upwind)
- Different network geometries (small grid, rectangular, periodic)
- Mass conservation enforcement
- Numerical properties (finiteness, backward/forward propagation)

## Test Quality Standards

All new tests follow consistent patterns:

### Test Structure
1. **Initialization Tests** - Configuration and parameter validation
2. **Solve Method Tests** - Core solver functionality
3. **Numerical Properties Tests** - Mathematical correctness
4. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end solver behavior
5. **Helper Method Tests** - Utility function validation

### Test Robustness
- **Appropriate tolerances** for stochastic/numerical methods
- **Finite checks** for all solutions
- **Shape validation** for array outputs
- **Edge case handling** (zero density, boundary conditions)
- **Deprecated parameter testing** with proper warnings

### Documentation Quality
- Comprehensive docstrings with mathematical context
- Clear test purpose descriptions
- Expected behavior documentation
- References to implementation details (file:line)

## Commits and Merges

### Unit Test Additions (5 commits)
1. `46a2ce3` - HJB FDM solver tests (375 lines, 20+ tests)
2. `f4237d5` - Network HJB solver tests (536 lines, 30+ tests)

### Merge Strategy

- Each test file verified to pass independently
- No breaking changes to existing code
- Clean commit history with descriptive messages

## Coverage Impact

### Before Phase 2.2a
- HJB solvers: Minimal unit test coverage
- FP solvers: No dedicated unit tests
- Network solvers: Only integration tests

### After Phase 2.2a
- **HJB solvers**: Comprehensive unit test coverage (80+ tests)
  - FDM solver: 20+ tests
  - Network solver: 30+ tests
  - WENO solver: 30 tests (19 existing + 11 new)

- **FP solvers**: Complete unit test coverage (63+ tests)
  - Network solver: 27 tests
  - Particle solver: 36 tests

- **Integration tests**: Reviewed and validated (83/102 passing)

## Issues Addressed

### Issue #140: GFDM Solver Refactoring
- **Status**: Tests currently skipped (18 tests)
- **Reason**: Awaiting GFDM implementation refactoring
- **Note**: Pre-existing issue, not introduced by Phase 2.2a

### Mass Conservation Test Instability
- **Status**: 1 known failure in `test_mass_conservation_1d_simple.py`
- **Reason**: Pre-existing numerical convergence issue
- **History**: Known instability since commit `827e9f7`
- **Note**: Not related to Phase 2.2a unit test additions

## Key Learnings

### 1. Grid Convention Differences
Different solvers may use different grid conventions (Nx vs Nx+1). Always verify array shapes when writing integration tests.

### 2. Stochastic Method Testing
Particle methods with KDE require relaxed tolerances and statistical validation (center of mass, mass conservation) rather than point-wise comparison.

### 3. Backward Compatibility Testing
Always test deprecated parameters with `pytest.warns(DeprecationWarning)` to ensure proper warning emission.

### 4. Test Independence
Each test should be self-contained and not rely on previous test state. Use fixtures for shared setup.

## Next Steps (Phase 2.3)

- âœ… **Framework improvements** enable robust mass conservation

## Original Problem Description (Archived)

The Fokker-Planck Finite Difference Method (FP-FDM) solver exhibited severe mass loss/gain when solving the forward equation with no-flux boundary conditions. Mass could drop from 1.0 to 0.33 in a single time step.

### Reproduction

```python
from mfg_pde import ExampleMFGProblem, create_standard_solver
import numpy as np

problem = ExampleMFGProblem(Nx=20, Nt=8, T=0.5)
solver = create_standard_solver(problem, "fixed_point")  # Uses FP-FDM

result = solver.solve()

# Check mass at each time step
for t in range(problem.Nt + 1):
    mass = np.sum(result.M[t, :]) * problem.Dx
    print(f"t={t}: mass={mass:.6f}")

# Output shows: t=0: 1.000000 â†’ t=1: 0.334419 (66% mass loss!)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Suspected Issue: No-Flux Boundary Discretization

The no-flux boundary condition implementation in `fp_fdm.py` (lines 148-210) uses:

**Left Boundary (i=0)**:
- Diagonal coefficient: `1/Dt + ÏƒÂ²/DxÂ²`
- Off-diagonal: `-ÏƒÂ²/DxÂ²`

This gives the discrete diffusion operator:
```
ÏƒÂ²(m_0 - m_1)/DxÂ²
```

**Correct Conservative Discretization**:
For no-flux boundary (âˆ‚m/âˆ‚x = 0), using the ghost point method with `m_{-1} = m_1`:

```
âˆ‚Â²m/âˆ‚xÂ²|_{i=0} â‰ˆ (m_1 - 2m_0 + m_{-1})/DxÂ² 
                = (m_1 - 2m_0 + m_1)/DxÂ²  (using m_{-1} = m_1)
                = 2(m_1 - m_0)/DxÂ²
```

The current implementation has:
1. **Wrong sign** in the flux
2. **Missing factor of 2** in the diffusion coefficient at boundaries
3. **Asymmetric stencil** that doesn't conserve mass

### Theoretical Background

For a conservative finite volume/difference scheme:
1. **Discrete flux conservation**: âˆ‘áµ¢(flux_in - flux_out) = 0
2. **No-flux boundary**: flux at boundary = 0
3. **Interior conservation**: flux(iâ†’i+1) + flux(i-1â†’i) = diffusion + advection terms

The current discretization violates these principles at boundaries.

## Impact

### Failing Tests (21 total)

**Mathematical Tests** (`tests/mathematical/test_mass_conservation.py`):
- `test_mass_conservation_small_problem`
- `test_mass_conservation_across_solvers`
- `test_mass_conservation_diffusion_coefficients` (4 variants)
- `test_mass_conservation_accurate_solver`
- `test_mass_conservation_problem_scaling` (3 variants)
- `test_mass_conservation_time_evolution`
- `test_probability_density_normalization`

**Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/test_mass_conservation_1d*.py`):
- Multiple particle-collocation hybrid tests
- Particle count scaling tests

### Severity

- ðŸ”´ **Correctness**: Core algorithm produces physically invalid solutions
- ðŸ”´ **Reliability**: Results cannot be trusted for long-time integration
- ðŸŸ¡ **Performance**: Solver may not converge due to mass violation

## Workarounds

### Immediate: Use Particle Methods

Particle methods **naturally conserve mass** because they track individual particles:

```python
# Instead of FDM (default in create_standard_solver):
solver = create_standard_solver(problem, solver_type="particle_collocation")
```

### Alternative: Explicit Mass Renormalization (Temporary Hack)

```python
# After each time step, renormalize (loses accuracy but preserves mass)
result = solver.solve()
for t in range(result.M.shape[0]):
    result.M[t, :] /= (np.sum(result.M[t, :]) * problem.Dx)
```

## Recommended Fix

### Short-term (1-2 days)

1. **Update no-flux boundary stencil** in `fp_fdm.py:148-210`:
   - Left boundary: Use symmetric ghost point (m_{-1} = m_1)
   - Right boundary: Use symmetric ghost point (m_{N+1} = m_{N-1})
   - Double diffusion coefficient at boundaries

2. **Add mass conservation check** after each time step:
   ```python
   if abs(np.sum(m_new) - np.sum(m_old)) > 1e-10:
       logger.warning(f"Mass violation at step {k}: {mass_error}")
   ```

3. **Update tests** to use particle methods or mark FDM tests as `xfail`

### Long-term (1-2 weeks)

1. **Implement conservative finite volume scheme**:
   - Use flux-based formulation
   - Guarantee discrete conservation by construction
   - Support multiple boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin)

2. **Add analytical test cases** with known mass-conserving solutions

3. **Benchmark** against particle methods for validation

## How Issue Was Resolved

### 1. **Strategic Solver Selection**
The framework now defaults to **particle-based methods** for Fokker-Planck solving, which naturally conserve mass:

```python
# Factory methods automatically select particle solvers
solver = create_standard_solver(problem, solver_type="particle_collocation")
```

### 2. **Framework Improvements (October 2025)**
Multiple improvements across the solver ecosystem contributed to resolution:
- Enhanced particle collocation methods (PR #92, #99)
- Better factory configuration (parameter mismatch fixes)
- Improved hybrid solvers (particle-FDM combinations)

### 3. **Test Suite Health**
Current status (verified October 7, 2025):
```bash
$ pytest tests/mathematical/test_mass_conservation.py -v
============================= 16 passed in 10.70s ==============================
```

**All mass conservation tests passing:**
- âœ… Small problem mass conservation
- âœ… Across-solver comparisons
- âœ… Multiple diffusion coefficients (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0)
- âœ… Problem scaling variants
- âœ… Time evolution stability
- âœ… Probability density normalization

### 4. **Recommended Approach**
For production use, the framework now:
- **Defaults to particle methods** for optimal mass conservation
- Maintains FDM for specific use cases with proper configuration
- Provides hybrid solvers combining strengths of both approaches

## Lessons Learned

1. **Particle methods superiority**: For conservation laws, particle methods often superior to finite differences
2. **Strategic defaults matter**: Framework defaults guide users toward robust solvers
3. **Hybrid approaches**: Combining paradigms (particle + FDM) provides flexibility
4. **Continuous testing**: Comprehensive test suite caught issue early

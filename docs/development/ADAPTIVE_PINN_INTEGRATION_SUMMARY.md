p(x) ∝ |R(x)|^α
```

- **Gradual problem difficulty** increase during training

### 3. **Dynamic Loss Weighting**
```python
# Automatic loss balance optimization
w_i ∝ 1/L_i  # Inverse weighting for gradient balance
```

- **Momentum-based updates** for stable adaptation
- **Gradient balancing** across physics, boundary, and initial losses

### 4. **Residual-Based Refinement**
```python
# Adaptive mesh refinement
Add points where |R(x)| > threshold
```
- **Targeted sampling** in regions with high physics residuals
- **Configurable refinement frequency** and factors
- **Adaptive mesh density** based on solution quality

### 5. **Multi-Scale Training**
- **Hierarchical resolution progression** from coarse to fine
- **Configurable scale transitions** with timing control
- **Multi-resolution learning** for complex problems

### 6. **Stagnation Detection**
- **Automatic detection** of training plateaus
- **Configurable patience** and improvement thresholds
- **Early intervention** capabilities for stuck training

### **Configuration Framework**
```python
# Enable advanced adaptive training
config = PINNConfig(
    enable_advanced_adaptive=True,
    adaptive_config={
        'enable_curriculum': True,
        'curriculum_epochs': 5000,

        'enable_refinement': True,
        'residual_threshold': 1e-3
    }
)
```

### **Training Loop Integration**
The adaptive strategies are seamlessly integrated into the existing training loop:

1. **Pre-training**: Initialize adaptive strategy if enabled
2. **Each epoch**:
   - Update curriculum complexity
   - Apply physics-guided sampling
   - Compute adaptive loss weights
   - Check for stagnation
3. **Refinement epochs**: Update sampling points based on residuals

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### **Demonstrated Benefits**
- **Faster convergence** through intelligent sampling
- **Better solution quality** via adaptive refinement
- **Automatic hyperparameter tuning** for loss weights
- **Robust training** with stagnation detection

### **Computational Overhead**
- **Minimal overhead**: Adaptive computations are lightweight
- **Configurable frequency**: Adaptive updates can be tuned for performance
- **Optional features**: All adaptive capabilities can be disabled for standard training

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

### **Existing Code Unchanged**
```python
# Existing code continues to work without modification
solver = MFGPINNSolver(problem, config)
solver.train()  # Uses standard training by default
```

### **Opt-in Adaptive Features**
```python
# Enable adaptive features explicitly
config.enable_advanced_adaptive = True
solver = MFGPINNSolver(problem, config)
solver.train()  # Now uses adaptive training strategies
```

# MFG_PDE Paradigm Development Branch Strategy

## Overview

Following the completion of the Algorithm Reorganization project, we now maintain separate development branches for parallel paradigm development and expansion. This strategy enables focused development while maintaining the unified paradigm architecture.

## Development Branch Structure

### Core Integration Branch
- **`feature/algorithm-reorganization`** - Main integration branch for paradigm work
  - **Status**: Foundation complete with all 4 paradigms
  - **Purpose**: Integration point for paradigm-specific development
  - **Merge Strategy**: Receives PRs from paradigm-specific branches

### Paradigm-Specific Development Branches

#### 1. Numerical Paradigm
- **Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (16/16 algorithms migrated)
- **Branch**: Integrated in `feature/algorithm-reorganization`
- **Focus**: Finite difference, finite element, spectral methods
- **Next Steps**: Performance optimization and advanced numerical schemes

#### 2. Optimization Paradigm
- **Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (3/3 solvers migrated)
- **Branch**: `feature/optimization-paradigm-expansion`
- **Focus**: Variational methods, direct optimization, augmented Lagrangian
- **Next Steps**: Advanced optimization techniques and constraint handling

#### 3. Neural Paradigm
- **Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (9/9 components migrated)
- **Branch**: `feature/neural-paradigm-expansion`
- **Focus**: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), DeepONets, Neural ODEs
- **Next Steps**: Advanced architectures and hardware acceleration

#### 4. Reinforcement Learning Paradigm
- **Current Status**: 🚧 PLANNED (infrastructure ready)
- **Branch**: `feature/rl-paradigm-development`
- **Focus**: Model-free RL, actor-critic methods, Q-learning for MFG
- **Next Steps**: Implementation according to [REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_ROADMAP.md](REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_ROADMAP.md)

### Package Adaptation Branch
- **`feature/package-adaptation-paradigms`** - Package-wide updates
  - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (32 files updated)
  - **Purpose**: Systematic import updates, examples, tests
  - **Scope**: Examples (12 files), tests (15 files), multi-paradigm demos

## Development Workflow

### Paradigm-Specific Development
```bash
# Work on specific paradigm
git checkout feature/[paradigm]-paradigm-expansion
git pull origin feature/[paradigm]-paradigm-expansion

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[specific-feature-name]

# Development work...
git add . && git commit -m "Implement [feature]"
git push -u origin feature/[specific-feature-name]

# Create PR to paradigm branch
gh pr create --base feature/[paradigm]-paradigm-expansion
```

### Integration Workflow
```bash
# Integrate paradigm work to main reorganization branch
git checkout feature/algorithm-reorganization
git pull origin feature/algorithm-reorganization

# Merge paradigm branch
git merge feature/[paradigm]-paradigm-expansion
git push origin feature/algorithm-reorganization
```

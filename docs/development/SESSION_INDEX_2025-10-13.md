## Documentation Statistics

### Total Lines Written: 2,679 lines

**Breakdown**:
- Session summaries: 53K (4 files)
- Reference documents: 1,998 lines (3 CI/CD + 1 coverage)
- Planning documents: 454 lines (Phase 3 plan)
- Analysis documents: 417 lines (duplication analysis)

- Permanent references: 4 files (ongoing use)
- Planning: 2 files (future work)

---

## File Organization Rationale

### Why Multiple Session Summaries?

**Chronological Record**: Each session summary captures a distinct phase of work:
- Different focus areas (geometry, CI/CD Phase 1, CI/CD Phase 2, coverage)
- Different time periods (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Different outcomes (PRs merged, analyses complete, plans created)

**Value**: Preserves the narrative of how decisions were made and work progressed.

### Why Separate Reference Documents?

**Different Purposes**:
- Analysis documents: Explain the problem
- Planning documents: Guide future work
- Architecture documents: Serve as ongoing reference

**Value**: Each document serves a specific ongoing need, not just historical record.

# Issue #597 Milestone 3 Summary: Advection Operator Integration

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Hybrid Strategy)
**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Effort**: ~6 hours implementation + testing
**Original Estimate**: 4-6 weeks (full operator-based implicit solver)
**Actual Scope**: Hybrid approach (operator-based explicit + validated manual implicit)

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully integrated AdvectionOperator into the FP solver framework using a **Hybrid Defect Correction Strategy**. This approach balances modern operator abstraction with robust numerical stability.

**Key Achievement**: Eliminated ~200 lines of duplicated advection code in explicit solvers while preserving the validated implicit solver implementation.

---

## The Godunov Paradox

During implementation, discovered a fundamental mathematical constraint:

**Problem**: `tensor_calculus.advection` uses **Godunov upwinding** (state-dependent flux limiting), which is:
- Globally linear: `A(αm) = αA(m)` ✓
- Locally nonlinear: Upwind direction depends on `∇m` itself ✗

**Impact**: Cannot extract sparse Jacobian matrix via standard basis vector probing. For implicit solvers requiring `J @ δm = -R`, this approach fails.

```python
# Unit vector test reveals the issue:
e_1 = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  # Impulse at position 1
A @ e_1 = [-4, 4, 0, 0, 0]  # Nonzero only near impulse

# But for distributed field:
m = [0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 3.0, 0.0]
A @ m ≠ 2*(A @ e_1) + 3*(A @ e_3)  # Superposition fails!
```

The operator is **linear but not basis-decomposable** under Godunov upwinding.

## Strategic Decision: Hybrid Approach (Option 3)

**Chosen Strategy**: Defect Correction framework

| Component | Method | Rationale |
|:----------|:-------|:----------|
| **Explicit Solvers** | AdvectionOperator (Godunov) | High-accuracy shock capturing, mass conservation |
| **Implicit LHS (Jacobian)** | Manual velocity-based upwind | Linear, M-matrix stability, well-conditioned |
| **Implicit RHS (Residual)** | Can use either (currently manual) | Flexibility for future upgrades |

**Mathematical Framework**:
```
Solve: J(m^k) δm = -R(m^k)
Update: m^{k+1} = m^k + δm

where:
- J = Linear velocity-upwind Jacobian (manual sparse)
- R = Nonlinear Godunov residual (can use operator or manual)
```

This is **standard CFD practice** (e.g., SIMPLE algorithm, inexact Newton methods).

## Implementation Details

### 1. Refactored Explicit Advection Functions

**File**: `mfg_pde/alg/numerical/fp_solvers/fp_fdm_advection.py`

**Before** (~120 lines manual upwind):
```python
def _compute_upwind_advection(M, drift_per_dim, spacing, ndim):
    """Manual upwind flux computation with numpy.diff logic."""
    advection = np.zeros_like(M)
    for d in range(ndim):
        # ... 50 lines of upwind flux logic ...
    return advection
```

**After** (~15 lines operator-based):
```python
def compute_advection_term_nd(M, U, coupling_coefficient, spacing, ...):
    """Compute advection using AdvectionOperator (Issue #597 M3)."""
    from mfg_pde.geometry.operators.advection import AdvectionOperator

    # Compute drift velocity
    drift_per_dim = [-coupling_coefficient * np.gradient(U, dx, axis=d)
                     for d in range(ndim)]
    velocity_field = np.stack(drift_per_dim, axis=0)

    # Apply operator
    adv_op = AdvectionOperator(velocity_field, spacings, M.shape,
                               scheme="upwind", form="divergence", bc=bc)
    return adv_op(M)
```

**Functions Refactored**:
- `compute_advection_term_nd()` - MFG-coupled (drift from ∇U)
- `compute_advection_from_drift_nd()` - Standalone (direct drift input)
- `_compute_upwind_advection()` - Deprecated, legacy fallback

**Benefits**:
- 85% code reduction (120 → 15 lines)
- Automatic BC handling via operator
- Consistent with LaplacianOperator pattern

### 2. Preserved Implicit Solver Implementation

**Files** (unchanged, now documented):
- `fp_fdm_time_stepping.py` - Main implicit solver loop
- `fp_fdm_alg_gradient_upwind.py` - Gradient form + upwind
- `fp_fdm_alg_gradient_centered.py` - Gradient form + centered
- `fp_fdm_alg_divergence_upwind.py` - Divergence form + upwind
- `fp_fdm_alg_divergence_centered.py` - Divergence form + centered

**Why Keep These?**

1. **Correctness**: Validated implementation (45 passing tests)
2. **Performance**: O(N) direct sparse assembly vs O(N²) probing
3. **Mathematical Necessity**: Linear Jacobian required for convergence
4. **Risk Mitigation**: No regression risk from rewriting kernel

**Added Documentation**:
```python
"""
Issue #597 Milestone 3 - Hybrid Operator Strategy:

    - Explicit solvers: Use AdvectionOperator for Godunov fluxes
    - Implicit solvers: Use manual sparse construction for linear Jacobian

    This is Defect Correction: stable linear LHS, accurate nonlinear RHS.
"""
```

### 3. Testing & Validation

**Test Suite**: 45/45 FP solver tests passing ✓

| Test Category | Count | Status |
|:--------------|:------|:-------|
| Basic solution | 6 | ✓ PASS |
| Callable diffusion | 8 | ✓ PASS |
| Array diffusion | 4 | ✓ PASS |
| Tensor diffusion | 12 | ✓ PASS |
| Callable drift | 4 | ✓ PASS |
| Edge cases | 11 | ✓ PASS |

**No regressions** - All existing tests pass with refactored explicit solvers.

## Impact Assessment

### Positive

✅ **Code Quality**: Reduced duplication in explicit solvers (~200 lines eliminated)
✅ **Consistency**: AdvectionOperator pattern matches LaplacianOperator
✅ **Documentation**: Clear explanation of hybrid approach for future maintainers
✅ **Testing**: 100% test pass rate, no regressions
✅ **Flexibility**: Easy to swap Godunov residual in future (residual-only use)

### Neutral

⚪ **Implicit Solver**: Unchanged (manual sparse construction preserved)
⚪ **Performance**: No measurable impact (explicit path ~same speed)
⚪ **API**: Backward compatible (new parameters optional)

### Lessons Learned

📚 **Godunov paradox**: State-dependent upwinding breaks sparse matrix extraction
📚 **Defect Correction**: Standard CFD technique for nonlinear solvers
📚 **Pragmatism**: Sometimes "manual" is the right answer
📚 **Documentation > Abstraction**: Clear docs on "why manual" beats forced elegance

---

## Comparison to Original Plan

**Original Plan** (from implementation plan):
- Replace ~1,000 lines of manual matrix construction
- 4 advection schemes via AdvectionOperator
- Full operator-based implicit solver
- Estimated 4-6 weeks

**Actual Implementation**:
- Replaced ~200 lines in explicit solvers only
- Preserved manual implementation for implicit solver
- Documented hybrid approach
- Completed in ~6 hours

**Why the Change?**

Discovered Godunov upwind incompatibility during Phase 1 verification. User guidance confirmed hybrid approach is standard practice and mathematically sound.

## Future Work

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Residual Evaluation**: Consider using AdvectionOperator for RHS in implicit defect correction loop (requires iteration testing)

2. **VelocityUpwindOperator**: If full operator abstraction needed, create separate operator class:
   ```python
   class VelocityUpwindOperator(LinearOperator):
       """Linear velocity-based upwind for implicit Jacobians."""
       def as_scipy_sparse(self):
           # Direct assembly (not unit-vector probing)
           return build_velocity_upwind_matrix(...)
   ```

3. **Higher-Order Schemes**: WENO, ENO schemes could benefit from operator framework

4. **GPU Acceleration**: AdvectionOperator backend-agnostic, enables future GPU support

### Not Planned

❌ Converting implicit solver to operator-based (unnecessary, current approach optimal)
❌ Removing manual sparse matrix files (these are the correct Jacobian)
❌ "Purity" refactoring (pragmatism > elegance)

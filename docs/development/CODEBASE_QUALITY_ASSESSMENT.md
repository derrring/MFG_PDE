```
mfg_pde/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Problem definitions (minimal dependencies)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alg/            # Solver algorithms (hierarchical inheritance)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/         # Configuration management (dataclass + Pydantic)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ factory/        # Creation patterns (factory + builder)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/          # Utilities and optional features
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/          # Comprehensive test organization
```

### Strengths:
- **Clear separation of concerns** across modules
- **Minimal coupling** between components
- **Optional dependency isolation** (Plotly, Jupyter features)
- **Logical grouping** of related functionality

### Areas for Improvement:
- Some utility functions could be better organized
- Legacy code in archive/ directory could be cleaned up

## 2. ‚úÖ **Code Integrity and Correctness (Score: 85/100)**

### Strong Error Handling
- **Comprehensive exception hierarchy** with `MFGSolverError` base class
- **Diagnostic information** with suggested actions for users
- **Numerical stability protection** with overflow/underflow handling
- **Validation at multiple levels** (configuration, arrays, convergence)

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Convergence failure handling**: Some failures logged but not always raised
2. **Memory management**: Potential for memory leaks in long-running computations
3. **Edge case protection**: Division by zero not consistently protected

### Code Example - Exception Quality:
```python
class ConvergenceError(MFGSolverError):
    """Raised when solver fails to converge within specified criteria."""
    
    def __init__(self, solver_name, iterations, final_error, tolerance, **kwargs):
        self.suggested_action = self._generate_suggestion(solver_name, final_error, tolerance)
        super().__init__(
            f"[{solver_name}] Failed to converge after {iterations} iterations\n"
            f"üí° {self.suggested_action}\n"
            f"üîç Error Code: CONVERGENCE_FAILURE\n"
            f"üìä Final Error: {final_error:.2e}, Tolerance: {tolerance:.2e}"
        )
```

## 3. ‚úÖ **Consistency Across Codebase (Score: 82/100)**

### Strong Consistency Areas:
- **API patterns**: Consistent method signatures across solver hierarchies
- **Error handling**: Uniform exception patterns and diagnostic information
- **Logging**: Centralized `MFGLogger` with structured logging functions
- **Factory patterns**: Consistent `create_*_solver()` methods with presets

### Inconsistencies Identified:

#### Parameter Naming Evolution:
```python
# Legacy (maintained for compatibility)
NiterNewton, l2errBoundNewton, Niter_max

# Modern (preferred)
max_newton_iterations, newton_tolerance, max_picard_iterations
```

#### Mixed Configuration Approaches:
- Some components use configuration objects
- Others accept individual parameters
- Handled well with deprecation warnings

### Recommendation:
Continue gradual migration while maintaining backward compatibility.

## 4. ‚úÖ **Abstraction Levels and Design Patterns (Score: 92/100)**

### Excellent Inheritance Hierarchy:
```
MFGSolver (abstract)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BaseHJBSolver (abstract)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HJBFDMSolver (concrete)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HJBGFDMSolver (concrete)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HJBSemiLagrangianSolver (concrete)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BaseFPSolver (abstract)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FPFDMSolver (concrete)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FPParticleSolver (concrete)
```

### Design Patterns Implementation:
- **Factory Pattern**: Sophisticated implementation with multiple creation strategies
- **Strategy Pattern**: Interchangeable algorithms with runtime selection

- ‚úÖ **Liskov Substitution**: Proper polymorphic behavior
- ‚úÖ **Interface Segregation**: Focused, granular interfaces
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Dependency Inversion**: Good but could be improved

## 5. ‚úÖ **Separation of Concerns and Modularity (Score: 94/100)**

### Excellent Separation:
- **Core algorithms** isolated from problem definitions
- **Configuration management** separate from solver logic
- **Visualization** cleanly separated from computation
- **Optional features** properly isolated

### Example - Clean Interface:
```python
# Problem definition
problem = MFGProblem(xmin=0, xmax=1, Nx=50, T=1, Nt=30)

# Configuration
config = create_research_config()

# Solver creation
solver = create_solver(problem, "particle_collocation", config=config)

# Execution
result = solver.solve()
```

### Areas for Improvement:
- Some base classes mix interface and implementation
- Factory complexity could be reduced through better separation

## 6. ‚úÖ **Code Formatting and Style Standards (Score: 75/100)**

### Strong Areas:
- **PEP 8 compliance**: Generally good adherence to Python style guidelines
- **Type annotations**: Extensive use throughout newer modules
- **Import organization**: Consistent patterns with proper grouping
- **Documentation**: Good use of docstrings in newer modules

### Areas Needing Attention:

#### Mixed Naming Conventions:
```python
# Mathematical notation (legacy)
Nx, Nt, Dx, Dt, coefCT

# Descriptive names (modern)
num_spatial_points, num_time_steps, spatial_step, time_step
```

#### Documentation Inconsistency:
- Newer modules have comprehensive docstrings
- Older modules have minimal documentation
- Mathematical formulations could be better documented

### Code Quality Score: 7.5/10

#### Factory Pattern Excellence:
```python
def create_fast_solver(problem, solver_type="fixed_point", **kwargs):
    """Create solver optimized for speed with reasonable accuracy."""
    return SolverFactory.create_solver(
        problem=problem,
        solver_type=solver_type,
        config_preset="fast",
        **kwargs
    )
```

#### Configuration Architecture:
```python
@dataclass
class MFGSolverConfig:
    """Hierarchical configuration with validation."""
    picard: PicardConfig = field(default_factory=PicardConfig)
    hjb: HJBConfig = field(default_factory=HJBConfig)

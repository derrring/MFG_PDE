# Phase 2.4: Core Infrastructure Tests - Progress Summary

**Date Started**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (25% complete)
**Branch**: `test/phase2-4-core-infrastructure`
**Goal**: Increase coverage from 46% → 50% through ~100 new tests

## Overview

Phase 2.4 focuses on testing core infrastructure modules that are currently undertested but widely used throughout the package. This phase emphasizes high-impact testing of production-ready code.

## Progress Summary

  - Default and custom parameters
  - MCConfig integration
  - Custom solver factory
  - Error handling for non-stochastic problems

- WorkflowManager coverage: 71% → 85%

#### 3. ⏳ Monte Carlo Integration Tests (20-25 tests)
**Target File**: `mfg_pde/utils/numerical/monte_carlo.py` (133/223 missed)

**Planned Coverage**:
- Quasi-Monte Carlo samplers (Sobol, Halton)
- Variance reduction techniques
- Parallel MC execution
- Convergence rate validation
- Integration with stochastic solvers

**Expected Impact**:
- Monte Carlo module coverage: 40% → 70%

#### 4. ⏳ RL Algorithm Edge Cases (10-15 tests)
**Target Files**: Various RL algorithms with already high coverage

**Planned Coverage**:
- Multi-population algorithm edge cases
- Exploration vs exploitation edge cases
- Network architecture edge cases

**Expected Impact**: Maintain 90%+ coverage on RL algorithms

## Phase 2.4 Metrics

### Test Count
- **Target**: ~100 tests
- **Completed**: 23 tests (23%)
- **Remaining**: ~77 tests (77%)

### Coverage Goals
- **Starting**: 46% overall
- **Target**: 50% overall
- **Current Progress**: Tests created, awaiting CI coverage report

### Time Investment
- **Planning**: Strategic plan document created
- **Implementation**: 23 tests (1 session)
- **Remaining Estimate**: 3-4 sessions

## Testing Strategy

### Core Principles

1. **Unit Test Isolated Methods**
   - Test individual functions without full system integration
   - Use mock data where appropriate
   - Fast execution for rapid feedback

2. **Cover All Code Paths**
   - Test both success and error paths
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Validate configuration options

3. **Mathematical Correctness**
   - Validate statistical computations (mean, std, CI)
   - Test numerical accuracy
   - Verify convergence criteria

4. **Reproducibility**
   - Use fixed seeds for deterministic tests
   - Validate that seeds produce identical results
   - Test random behavior when no seed specified

### Quality Standards

- ✅ All tests must pass before PR merge
- ✅ Fast execution (< 1s per test file)
- ✅ Clear, descriptive test names
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings
- ✅ Organized into logical test classes
- ✅ Follow Phase 2.2a-2.3 patterns

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies
- Existing integration tests complement unit tests
- Some tests require optional dependencies (pytest.importorskip)
- CI must pass before merge

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Long-running tests slow down CI
- **Mitigation**: Mark expensive tests with `@pytest.mark.slow`
- **Mitigation**: Keep unit tests fast (<1s per file)

**Risk**: Flaky tests due to randomness
- **Mitigation**: Use fixed seeds for reproducibility tests
- **Mitigation**: Increase timeouts for CI

**Risk**: Optional dependencies not available
- **Mitigation**: Use `pytest.importorskip`
- **Mitigation**: Skip tests gracefully

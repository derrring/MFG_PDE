## Technical Decisions

### 1. Focus on Core Infrastructure

**Decision**: Prioritize numerical utilities and workflow tools over application-specific code

**Rationale**:
- High-impact modules used throughout the package
- Previously untested (MCMC had 0% coverage)
- Clear API boundaries make testing straightforward
- Mathematical correctness can be validated analytically

### 2. Mathematical Validation Strategy

**Approach**: Use analytical solutions for numerical algorithm validation

**Examples**:
```python
# Monte Carlo: ∫₀¹ x dx = 0.5
def integrand(x):
    return x[:, 0]

result = monte_carlo_integrate(integrand, [(0.0, 1.0)], config)
assert abs(result.estimate - 0.5) < 0.05

# MCMC: Sample from N(0, 1)
def potential_fn(x):
    return 0.5 * np.sum(x**2)

# After sampling, check sample mean ≈ 0, std ≈ 1
```

**Benefits**:
- Tests both implementation AND mathematical correctness
- Provides confidence in numerical accuracy
- Catches subtle algorithmic errors

### 3. Handling Known Implementation Issues

**Example**: Anderson Acceleration divergence

**Discovery**: Anderson acceleration implementation has convergence issues for simple fixed-point problems

**Resolution**:
- Created 32 tests exposing the issue
- 18 tests passing (API/structure)
- 11 tests failing (convergence)
- **Decision**: Don't merge broken tests, document issue for future fix

**Lesson**: Test discovery can reveal implementation bugs - this is valuable!

### 4. Parallel Test Creation Strategy

**Workflow**:
1. Read source module thoroughly
2. Identify all public functions/classes
3. Write tests in parallel for different aspects:
   - Initialization/configuration
   - Basic functionality
   - Edge cases
   - Integration tests
   - Mathematical validation
4. Run incrementally, fix failures
5. Create PR immediately when passing

**Benefits**:
- Rapid coverage expansion
- Early CI feedback
- Incremental progress tracking

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Rapid Test Creation Works

**Observation**: Created and merged 127 tests in ~2 hours of focused work

**Keys to Success**:
- Clear understanding of module purpose
- Read source code thoroughly first
- Test multiple aspects in parallel
- Use analytical validation where possible
- Run incrementally to catch issues early

### 2. Mathematical Validation is Powerful

**Insight**: Testing numerical algorithms with known analytical solutions provides dual validation:
1. Implementation correctness
2. Mathematical accuracy

**Example**: Monte Carlo integration tests caught precision issues that pure API tests would miss.

### 3. CI as Quality Gate

**Process**: All PRs require full CI passing before merge

**Value**:
- Catches platform-specific issues
- Validates across Python versions
- Ensures no regressions
- Coverage tracking via Codecov

**Time cost**: ~8-9 minutes per PR, well worth it

### 4. Test Discovery Reveals Bugs

**Case Study**: Anderson Acceleration

**Process**:
1. Created comprehensive tests
2. Tests exposed divergence issues
3. Investigated implementation
4. Found algorithmic problems

**Outcome**: Don't merge broken tests, but document for future fix

**Value**: Testing isn't just validation - it's also discovery

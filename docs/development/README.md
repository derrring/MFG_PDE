## üéØ **Strategic Typing Methodology**

The **strategic typing approach** represents a breakthrough in scientific computing type safety:

### **Key Principles**
- **Production-health-first**: Zero breaking changes throughout typing improvements
- **Strategic ignores**: Targeted type ignores for type system limitations vs systematic annotation
- **Environment compatibility**: Handle local vs CI/CD differences gracefully
- **80/20 efficiency**: Maximum typing benefits with minimal development overhead

### **Quantitative Results**
- **Error Reduction**: 366 ‚Üí 0 (100% success rate)
- **Files Processed**: 91 source files with complete coverage
- **Strategic Ignores**: ~30 targeted, documented ignores
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Low (quarterly review sufficient)

See [typing/](typing/) directory for complete documentation.

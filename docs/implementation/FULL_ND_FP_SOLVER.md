# Full nD FP FDM Solver Implementation

**Date**: 2025-11-01
**Status**: Completed
**Replaces**: Dimensional splitting method (`fp_fdm_multid.py`)

---

## Executive Summary

Implemented a new full-dimensional Fokker-Planck FDM solver that directly assembles and solves the complete multi-dimensional sparse linear system instead of using dimensional splitting. This approach eliminates the catastrophic operator splitting errors that caused up to 81% mass loss in advection-dominated MFG problems.

**Key Achievement**: Replaces O(Δt) splitting error with proper coupled discretization, enabling stable solution of 2D/3D MFG problems with advection.

---

## Motivation

### Problem with Dimensional Splitting

The previous approach (`fp_fdm_multid.py`) used Strang splitting to decompose the multi-dimensional FP equation into sequential 1D solves:

```
∂m/∂t + ∇·(m v) = (σ²/2) Δm
```

**Dimensional splitting**:
```
m^{n+1} = S_d(Δt/2d) ∘ ... ∘ S_1(Δt/2d) ∘ ... ∘ S_d(Δt/2d) m^n
```

**Failure Mode**:
- **Pure diffusion** (v=0): ✓ Works perfectly (+0.000% mass error)
- **Full MFG** (strong v): ✗ Catastrophic failure (-81% mass loss)

**Root Causes**:
1. **High Péclet number**: Advection >> diffusion in MFG velocity fields
2. **Operator non-commutativity**: [A, D] ≠ 0 where A=advection, D=diffusion
3. **Error accumulation**: O(Δt) splitting error compounds over 15-30 Picard iterations
4. **Boundary contamination**: Intermediate 1D solves see incorrect boundary fluxes

## New Approach: Full-Dimensional System

### Mathematical Formulation

Instead of splitting, directly discretize the full operator:

```
(I/Δt + A + D) m^{n+1} = m^n / Δt
```

Where:
- **I**: Identity matrix (N_total × N_total, N_total = ∏ N_i)
- **A**: Full multi-D advection operator (upwind discretization)
- **D**: Full multi-D diffusion operator (centered differences)

### Sparse Matrix Structure

For 2D grid with indices (i,j):
- **Flat index**: `flat = i * N_y + j` (row-major order)
- **Stencil**: Each point couples to neighbors: (i±1,j), (i,j±1)
- **Matrix size**: N_x × N_y unknowns (e.g., 50×50 = 2500 unknowns)
- **Sparsity**: ~5 non-zeros per row (diagonal + 4 neighbors)

### Discretization

**Interior points** (i,j):
```
Diagonal term:
  (1/Δt) + σ²(1/Δx² + 1/Δy²) + advection upwind terms

Off-diagonal (neighbors):
  Diffusion: -σ²/(2Δx²) for (i±1,j), -σ²/(2Δy²) for (i,j±1)
  Advection: Upwind based on velocity sign (ppart/npart)
```

**Boundary points** (no-flux):
```
One-sided stencils for derivatives
Combined advection + diffusion flux = 0
```

## Implementation Details

### File Structure

```
mfg_pde/alg/numerical/fp_solvers/
├── fp_fdm.py                 # Unified FDM solver: 1D and full nD implementation
└── (archived)                # Dimensional splitting methods moved to docs/archived_methods/
```

**Note**: The full nD solver is now integrated directly into `fp_fdm.py` for a clean, unified interface.

### Key Functions

**`fp_fdm.py`** (unified implementation):

1. **`_solve_fp_nd_full_system()`**: Main entry point for nD solver
   - Allocates solution array
   - Time evolution loop (forward in time)
   - Returns full density evolution M(t,x)

2. **`_solve_timestep_full_nd()`**: Single timestep solve
   - Builds sparse matrix A in COO format
   - Assembles RHS vector b
   - Solves A*m_{k+1} = b using `sparse.linalg.spsolve`

3. **`_add_interior_entries()`**: Matrix assembly for interior points
   - Loops over all spatial dimensions
   - Adds diffusion terms (centered differences)
   - Adds advection terms (upwind scheme using ppart/npart)

4. **`_add_boundary_no_flux_entries()`**: Matrix assembly for boundaries
   - One-sided stencils for derivatives
   - Enforces zero flux condition

### Integration with Existing Code

**Routing** (`fp_fdm.py:79-91`):
```python
# Inside FPFDMSolver.solve_fp_system()
if self.dimension == 1:
    return self._solve_fp_1d(...)
else:
    # Multi-dimensional: Use full system solver (local function)
    return _solve_fp_nd_full_system(...)
```

**TensorProductGrid Integration**:
- Uses `grid.get_index()` / `grid.get_multi_index()` for flat ↔ multi-index conversion
- Uses `grid.spacing` for grid spacing in each dimension
- Uses `grid.total_points()` for matrix size

## Advantages vs Dimensional Splitting

| Aspect | Dimensional Splitting | Full nD System |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Splitting Error** | O(Δt) × ||[A,D]|| | None (coupled discretization) |
| **Mass Conservation** | Poor (-81% in MFG) | Good (~1-2% FDM error) |
| **Advection Stability** | Fails for high Pe | Stable for high Pe |
| **Complexity/Timestep** | O(N) per 1D sweep | O(N^d) unknowns |
| **Memory** | O(N) per 1D solve | O(N^d) sparse matrix |
| **Solve Time/Timestep** | Fast (1D solves) | Slower (larger system) |
| **Picard Iterations** | Many (error compounds) | Fewer (better coupling) |
| **Total Time** | May be slower overall! | May be faster overall |

**Key Insight**: Although each timestep is more expensive, the full nD solver may actually be **faster overall** because:
1. Better coupling → fewer Picard iterations needed for MFG convergence
2. No error accumulation → reaches tolerance faster
3. More stable → no divergence issues

## Performance Characteristics

### Complexity

- **Time per timestep**: O(N^d × nnz) where nnz ≈ 5N^d for 2D (sparse solve)
- **Memory**: O(N^d) for solution storage + O(5N^d) for sparse matrix
- **Practical limits**:
  - **2D**: N=200 → 40,000 unknowns (feasible)
  - **3D**: N=50 → 125,000 unknowns (slower but feasible)
  - **4D+**: Consider meshfree methods instead

### Typical Problem Sizes

| Grid | Unknowns | Sparse Matrix | Expected Time/Step |
|------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| 50×50 | 2,500 | 12.5k entries | ~10 ms |
| 100×100 | 10,000 | 50k entries | ~50 ms |
| 200×200 | 40,000 | 200k entries | ~200 ms |

problem = MyCrowdMotion2D(grid=grid, T=1.0, Nt=20, sigma=0.1)

# Solver automatically uses full nD method for 2D
solver = create_basic_solver(problem, damping=0.6, max_iterations=30)

result = solver.solve()

# Check mass conservation
dx, dy = problem.geometry.grid.spacing
dV = dx * dy
mass_initial = np.sum(result.M[0]) * dV
mass_final = np.sum(result.M[-1]) * dV
error = abs(mass_final - mass_initial) / mass_initial * 100
print(f"Mass error: {error:.2f}%")  # Expected: ~1-2%
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Iterative Solvers**: For very large systems, use `sparse.linalg.bicgstab` or `sparse.linalg.gmres` instead of direct `spsolve`

2. **Preconditioning**: Add ILU or AMG preconditioners for faster iterative solve

3. **Matrix Reuse**: Cache and reuse matrix structure across timesteps if velocity field doesn't change rapidly

4. **Parallel Assembly**: Use numba or cython to parallelize matrix assembly loop

5. **GPU Support**: Port sparse solve to CuPy for GPU acceleration

### Advanced Discretizations

1. **SUPG Stabilization**: Add Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin for better advection stability

2. **Flux Limiting**: Add TVD flux limiters to preserve monotonicity

3. **Higher-Order**: Implement WENO or MUSCL schemes for advection

4. **Adaptive Time**: Use adaptive timestep based on CFL condition

## Summary

The full nD FP FDM solver provides a robust, stable alternative to dimensional splitting for multi-dimensional MFG problems. By directly assembling and solving the coupled system, it eliminates the catastrophic operator splitting errors that plagued the previous approach, enabling reliable solution of advection-dominated MFG problems in 2D and 3D.

**Key Takeaway**: When advection is strong (high Péclet number), proper coupling of operators is essential. The computational cost of larger sparse systems is justified by correctness and stability.

## Documentation Quality Assessment

### Strengths

```
✅ Comprehensive Coverage:
├── 181 files analyzed
├── 3 weeks of sessions
└── Multiple experiments

✅ Quantitative Evidence:
├── 25+ measurements
├── Code line counts
└── Time tracking

✅ File References:
├── 65+ citations
├── Line numbers provided

```

### Limitations

```
⚠️ Research Code Focus:
├── mfg-research repository only
├── Did not analyze MFG_PDE source deeply
└── Relied on documented experiences

⚠️ Time Constraint:
├── 3 weeks of data
├── Not multi-year perspective
└── May miss seasonal patterns

⚠️ Experiment Coverage:
├── 2 experiments deeply analyzed
├── 1 experiment partially analyzed
└── Other potential experiments not attempted
```

### Confidence Levels

```
HIGH CONFIDENCE (Multiple Evidence Sources):
├── Problem class fragmentation
├── FDM 1D limitation
├── Bugs #13, #14, #15
└── Code duplication counts

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (Single Experiment):
├── OSQP performance issue
├── Picard damping
└── Specific API mismatches

LOW CONFIDENCE (Not Fully Explored):
├── Backend accessibility
├── Plugin system
└── Network problems
```

## Impact Projection

### Annual Cost (Extrapolated)

```
Based on 45 hours lost in 3 weeks:

Hours per year: 780 hours
├── 45 hours / 3 weeks
├── × 52 weeks/year
└── = 780 hours/year

Work weeks: 19.5 weeks
├── 780 hours
├── ÷ 40 hours/week
└── ≈ 5 months/year lost to workarounds

Research projects blocked: 2-3 per year
├── FDM baseline comparisons
├── Hybrid solver experiments
└── GPU acceleration studies
```

### If Refactoring Completed

```
Estimated Savings:
├── Time: 780 → 100 hours/year (87% reduction)
├── Code: 3,285 → 200 lines (94% reduction)
├── Integration: 38 → 5 hours (87% reduction)
└── Bugs: 1/week → 1/quarter (75% reduction)

ROI Calculation:
├── Refactoring cost: 5.5-9 months
├── Annual savings: 17 work-weeks
├── Break-even: ~1.5 years
└── 5-year ROI: 4.4× return
```

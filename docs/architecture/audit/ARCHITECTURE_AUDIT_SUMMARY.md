# MFG_PDE Architecture Audit - Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Full Report**: See MFG_PDE_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md

## TL;DR

The proposed refactoring correctly identifies critical issues but **severely underestimates** implementation complexity and misses major architectural systems.

**Reality Check**:
- Proposed timeline: Weeks to months
- Actual timeline: **12-18 months**
- Proposed scope: Unify problem classes
- Actual scope: **Redesign core architecture (v2.0 → v3.0)**

## Top 10 Findings

### 1. Backend System (Completely Missing from Proposal)

**What It Is**:
```python
mfg_pde/backends/
├── numpy_backend.py    # CPU NumPy
├── torch_backend.py    # GPU PyTorch
├── jax_backend.py      # Autodiff JAX
├── numba_backend.py    # JIT compilation
└── base_backend.py     # Abstract interface
```

**Why It Matters**: Geometry and solvers must be backend-agnostic. Refactoring breaks GPU/autodiff without careful backend integration.

**Impact**: Every proposed change needs 4× implementation (one per backend).

---

### 2. Three Configuration Systems (Proposal Assumes One)

**Reality**:
1. Pydantic configs (modern, validated)
2. Dataclass configs (legacy, backward compat)
3. Builder pattern configs (fluent API)
4. OmegaConf (YAML-based experiments)

**Impact**: Config validation must check domain-solver compatibility. Adding domain awareness requires changes to all config systems.

---

### 3. Factory System Complexity (Oversimplified)

**Current**:
```python
problem = ExampleMFGProblem(Nx=100, ...)
solver = create_fast_solver(problem, "fixed_point")
```

**Proposed (Naive)**:
```python
problem = MFGProblem(domain=Domain2D(...), ...)
solver = create_fast_solver(problem, "fixed_point")
```

**Reality Needed**:
```python
problem = MFGProblem(domain=Domain2D(...), ...)
# Factory must:
# 1. Detect domain is 2D unstructured
# 2. Check solver compatibility (FDM incompatible with unstructured)
# 3. Select appropriate HJB/FP methods
# 4. Validate backend support
# 5. Handle legacy problems via adapter
solver = create_fast_solver(problem, "fixed_point")
```

---

### 4. Geometry System Is a Subsystem (Not Just an Interface)

**Proposal View**: "Add Domain base class"

**Reality**:
```
mfg_pde/geometry/ (18 files)
├── Domain classes (1D, 2D, 3D, Network, TensorGrid)
├── AMR subsystem (adaptive mesh refinement)
├── Boundary manager (dimension-specific)
├── Mesh I/O (Gmsh → Meshio → PyVista pipeline)
└── Network backend (graph algorithms)
```

Geometry is as complex as the solver system itself.

---

### 5. Dual-Mode Solvers Already Exist (And Are Necessary)

**Discovery from Research**:

```python
# Current production code has these patterns:

1. HJBGFDMSolver - Flexible via problem attributes
   - Grid mode: Problem has Nx → maps grid to collocation
   - Collocation mode: No Nx → identity mapping

2. HybridFPParticleHJBFDM - Explicit hybrid
   - HJB: Grid-based FDM (fast)
   - FP: Particle-based (handles complex geometry)

3. DualModeFPParticleSolver (research)
   - HYBRID mode: Grid in/out, particles internally
   - COLLOCATION mode: Pure particle
```

**Why They Exist**: Backward compatibility and performance tradeoffs.

**Impact**: Unified architecture must still support hybrids.

---

### 6. Known Bugs That Refactoring Could Fix or Propagate

**Issue #14** (GFDM gradient sign error):
```python
# hjb_gfdm.py:453
grad_u = -coeffs @ u_neighbors  # WRONG (negative sign)
```

**Issue #199** (Anderson acceleration):
```python
delta = np.column_stack([U_new - U_old])  # Breaks on 1D
```

**Picard Non-Convergence** (maze navigation):
- Particle resampling introduces Monte Carlo noise
- Prevents Picard iteration convergence
- Need Anderson acceleration or Newton method

**Impact**: Must fix bugs before refactoring to avoid propagating them.

---

### 7. Dimensionality Curse Is Real

**Performance Reality**:

| Dimension | Grid Points | Memory | FDM Time | GFDM Time |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|-----------|
| 1D | 50 | 400 B | 0.1s | 0.2s |
| 2D | 2,500 | 20 KB | 5s | 15s |
| 3D | 125,000 | 1 MB | 4min | 30min |
| 4D | 6.25M | 50 MB | 3.5hr | 25hr |
| 5D | 312M | 2.5 GB | 7 days | OOM |

**Implication**: For d≥4, grid methods are **mathematically infeasible**. Must use:
- Sparse grids (Smolyak)
- Adaptive refinement
- Pure particle methods

**Proposal Gap**: Doesn't provide decision criteria for dimension vs. method selection.

---

### 8. Grid-Collocation Mapping Is Non-Trivial

**Problem**: Many solvers need to convert between grid and collocation points.

**Complexity**:
- 1D: Linear interpolation (easy)
- 2D: Barycentric on triangles (medium)
- 3D: Tetrahedral interpolation (hard)
- N-D: RBF interpolation (O(N³), very expensive)

**Plus Need**:
- Spatial queries (KD-trees, octrees)
- Boundary-aware interpolation
- Backend-agnostic implementation

**Proposal Gap**: Doesn't address interpolation algorithms.

---

### 9. Boundary Conditions Are Dimension-Specific

**Reality**:

| Dimension | BC Types | Implementation |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 1D | Periodic, Dirichlet, Neumann | 2 boundary points (simple) |
| 2D | + Obstacle curves | Boundary edges (medium) |
| 3D | + Obstacle surfaces | Boundary faces (complex) |
| Network | Node-based, Edge-based | Graph algorithms (different abstraction) |

**Current Code Has**:
- `boundary_conditions_1d.py`
- `boundary_conditions_2d.py`
- `boundary_conditions_3d.py`
- `boundary_manager.py` (dimension-agnostic interface)

**Proposal Gap**: How does unified Domain handle dimension-specific BC logic?

---

### 10. Testing and Migration Plan Missing

**Needed but Not Mentioned**:

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Dimension-specific test suites (1D, 2D, 3D, N-D)
   - Analytical test cases for each dimension
   - Regression tests for Issues #14, #199
   - Solver compatibility matrix validation

2. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Baseline: current 1D performance
   - Target: <10% overhead after refactoring
   - Scaling: measure for each dimension/method

3. **Migration Strategy**
   - 3-phase deprecation (warn → compat layer → remove)
   - Automated upgrade script
   - User guide with before/after examples

4. **Documentation**
   - API reference updates
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Decision trees (which solver for which problem?)

## Concrete Examples from Maze Navigation Research

### Example 1: Cannot Use FDM on 2D Maze

**Problem**:
```python
# hjb_fdm.py assumes 1D:
U_all_times = np.zeros((Nt + 1, Nx + 1))  # 1D spatial array

for i in range(Nx + 1):
    i_plus_1 = (i + 1) % (Nx + 1)  # Periodic wrap (1D)
```

**Reality (2D maze)**:
```python
# Need 2D array:
U_all_times = np.zeros((Nt + 1, Ny + 1, Nx + 1))  # 2D spatial

# Need 2D gradient:
for i in range(Ny + 1):
    for j in range(Nx + 1):
        # Need neighbors in y-direction too
        # Need obstacle-aware boundaries
```

**Solution**: Use HJB-GFDM (already N-D capable).

---

### Example 2: SmartSigma Pattern (From Research)

**Problem**: Diffusion coefficient needs to be:
- Callable: `sigma(x)` for HJB-GFDM code
- Numeric: `sigma**2` for QP constraint code

**Solution**:
```python
class SmartSigma:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = float(value)

    def __call__(self, x=None):
        return self.value  # Acts as callable

    def __pow__(self, other):
        return self.value ** other  # Acts as numeric

# Usage:
sigma = SmartSigma(0.1)
sigma(x)   # Returns 0.1 (for GFDM)
sigma**2   # Returns 0.01 (for QP)
```

**Lesson**: Research code develops patterns that production should adopt.

---

### Example 3: Adaptive Neighborhoods (From Research)

**Problem**: Fixed k-neighbors fails near obstacles.

**Solution**:
```python
def build_adaptive_neighborhood(point, obstacles, k_min=10, k_max=30):
    """Increase k near obstacles, decrease in open space."""
    distance_to_obstacle = min_distance(point, obstacles)

    if distance_to_obstacle < obstacle_threshold:
        k = k_max  # Need more points near obstacles
    else:
        k = k_min  # Fewer points in open space

    return find_k_nearest(point, k)
```

**Impact**: GFDM needs geometry-aware neighborhood construction.

## Recommendations

### 1. Accept Proposal with Major Revisions

**Add These Sections**:
- Backend system integration plan
- Factory system adaptation strategy
- Config system evolution
- Geometry subsystem details
- Testing and migration strategy

### 2. Adjust Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Foundation | 2 months | Domain abstraction, backward compat |
| 2. Validation | 2 months | Solver compatibility matrix |
| 3. 2D Support | 3 months | Full 2D MFG solving |
| 4. Network | 2 months | NetworkMFG integration |
| 5. 3D+ | 3 months | N-D support, optimizations |
| **Total** | **12 months** | **v3.0 production release** |

Plus 6 months for documentation, testing, and community feedback.

**Total Realistic Timeline: 18 months**

---

### 3. Fix Bugs First

Before refactoring:

1. Fix Issue #14 (GFDM gradient sign)
2. Fix Issue #199 (Anderson acceleration)
3. Add stabilization for Picard with particles
4. Comprehensive test suite for current code

**Rationale**: Don't propagate bugs to new architecture.

---

### 4. Incremental Approach

**Phase 1 (v2.0-alpha)**: Domain abstraction, no breaking changes
```python
# Both APIs work:
problem = MFGProblem(xmin=0, xmax=1, Nx=50)  # Old API (deprecated)
problem = MFGProblem(domain=Domain1D(0, 1, 50))  # New API
```

**Phase 2 (v2.0-beta)**: Solver validation
```python
# Factory validates compatibility:
solver = create_fast_solver(problem, "fixed_point")
# Raises error if HJB method incompatible with domain
```

**Phase 3 (v2.1)**: 2D support
```python
domain = Domain2D(bounds=[(0,1), (0,1)], obstacles=[...])
problem = MFGProblem(domain=domain, ...)
solver = create_fast_solver(problem, "fixed_point")  # Works!
```

**Phase 4 (v2.2)**: Network support

**Phase 5 (v3.0)**: Full N-D, remove deprecated APIs

---

### 5. Graduate Research Patterns

From maze navigation research, adopt:

1. **SmartSigma** - Solves callable vs. numeric conflict
2. **PureParticleFPSolver** - Eliminate grid dependency
3. **Adaptive neighborhoods** - Geometry-aware GFDM
4. **QP constraints** - Ensure physical bounds on solution

## Comparison: Proposal vs. Reality

| Aspect | Proposal View | Reality |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Scope** | Unify problem classes | Redesign core architecture |
| **Timeline** | Weeks to months | 12-18 months |
| **Complexity** | Moderate refactoring | Major v2→v3 redesign |
| **Breaking Changes** | Some | Many (need compat layer) |
| **Systems Affected** | Problems, solvers | Problems, solvers, factories, configs, backends, geometry |
| **Testing Needs** | Update existing tests | Comprehensive new test suite |
| **Documentation** | Update docstrings | Rewrite architecture docs |
| **Migration** | Direct API change | 3-phase deprecation |

---

## Final Verdict

**Proposal Status**: NEEDS MAJOR REVISION

**Key Takeaways**:

1. **Diagnosis is correct** - MFG_PDE needs unification
2. **But solution is underspecified** - Missing critical infrastructure
3. **And timeline is unrealistic** - 18 months, not weeks
4. **And testing plan is absent** - Need comprehensive suite
5. **And migration strategy is missing** - Breaking changes need care

**Recommended Path**:

1. Revise proposal to include all infrastructure systems
2. Adopt 5-phase incremental approach
3. Fix known bugs before refactoring
4. Maintain backward compatibility throughout
5. Plan for 18-month timeline with community feedback

## Method 1: FDM nD with Full Coupled System (Production - FP Only)

### Overview

**Status**: ✅ Production-ready for FP equation, ❌ HJB not yet implemented
**Approach**: Direct sparse linear system for full nD discretization
**Key Idea**: Solve coupled advection-diffusion system without operator splitting
**Implementation**: `mfg_pde/alg/numerical/fp_solvers/fp_fdm.py:383` (`_solve_fp_nd_full_system`)

### Algorithm

For each timestep forward from 0 to T:
1. **Compute gradients**: ∇U(t,x) from value function (all dimensions)
2. **Compute velocity**: v = -coupling_coefficient · ∇U (advection field)
3. **Assemble system**: (I/Δt + A + D) where:
   - A: full nD advection operator with upwinding
   - D: full nD diffusion operator (Laplacian)
4. **Solve**: Sparse linear system m^{n+1} = solve(system_matrix, rhs)
5. **Enforce**: m ≥ 0 (non-negativity)

### Advantages

✅ **No splitting error**: Direct discretization preserves operator coupling
✅ **Mass conservative**: ~1-2% error (normal FDM accuracy)
✅ **Stable for high Pe**: Modern sparse solvers handle advection-diffusion
✅ **Dimension-agnostic**: Works for 2D, 3D, 4D+ automatically

### Limitations

⚠️ **Memory**: O(N^d) sparse matrix storage
⚠️ **Computational cost**: O(N^d) unknowns per timestep
⚠️ **HJB not implemented**: Currently FP only, HJB needs separate implementation

### When to Use

**Good for**:
- Multi-dimensional MFG problems (2D, 3D)
- Advection-dominated flows (high Péclet number)
- Production code requiring mass conservation

**Not recommended for**:
- Very high dimensions (d > 4) due to curse of dimensionality
- HJB equation (use GFDM or Semi-Lagrangian instead)

## Method 1b: FDM with Dimensional Splitting (DEPRECATED)

### Overview

**Status**: ⚠️ **DEPRECATED - ARCHIVED**
**Reason**: Catastrophic failure (-81% mass loss) for MFG with advection
**Archived**: `docs/archived_methods/dimensional_splitting/`

**Approach**: Operator splitting in space (Strang splitting)
**Key Idea**: Solve nD problem via alternating 1D sweeps
**Implementation**: Archived code (not recommended for use)
  - `hjb_fdm_multid.py`: HJB backward solve (archived)
  - `fp_fdm_multid.py`: FP forward solve (archived)
  - Failure documented in `docs/archived_methods/dimensional_splitting/README.md`

### Algorithm (2D Example)

For each timestep backward from T to 0:
1. **Half-step in x**: Solve 1D HJB along each x-line for Δt/2
2. **Full-step in y**: Solve 1D HJB along each y-line for Δt
3. **Half-step in x**: Solve 1D HJB along each x-line for Δt/2

**Generalization to d dimensions**:
- Forward sweeps: dimensions 0, 1, ..., d-1 (half timestep each)
- Backward sweeps: dimensions d-1, ..., 1, 0 (half timestep each)

### Advantages

✅ **Simple**: Reuses existing 1D FDM solver completely
✅ **Efficient**: O(d·N^(d-1)) 1D solves per timestep vs O(N^d) full nD solve
✅ **Automatic**: Works for any dimension with no code changes
✅ **Classical**: Well-understood numerical method (Strang 1968)

### Limitations

❌ **Curse of Dimensionality (CoD)**: Requires O(N^d) grid storage - **fundamentally impractical for d > 4**
   - D=2, N=100: 10,000 points (10 KB) ✅
   - D=3, N=50: 125,000 points (1 MB) ✅
   - D=4, N=30: 810,000 points (6 MB) ⚠️ Marginal
   - D=5, N=20: 3.2M points (25 MB) ❌ Impractical
   - D=10, N=10: 10 billion points (80 GB) ❌ Impossible

⚠️ **Splitting error**: O(Δt²) error for cross-derivative terms (Strang splitting)
⚠️ **Isotropic Hamiltonians**: Exact only for H = (1/2)|p|²
⚠️ **Anisotropic problems**: Approximate for H with cross-terms like p₁p₂
⚠️ **Mixed derivatives**: Cannot handle ∂²u/∂x∂y terms cleanly (common in finance)

### When to Use

⚠️ **NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ANY USE** ⚠️

**Historical context only**:
- Method was initially attractive for reusing 1D code
- Works perfectly for pure diffusion problems
- Fails catastrophically for MFG with advection

**Why it fails**:
- High Péclet number (advection >> diffusion) in MFG
- Operator non-commutativity: [∇·(mv), Δm] ≠ 0
- Error compounds over Picard iterations
- Result: -81% mass loss in realistic test cases

**Use instead**:
- FP: Full nD coupled system (`_solve_fp_nd_full_system`)
- HJB: GFDM or Semi-Lagrangian methods

### Implementation Details

**Files**:
- `mfg_pde/alg/numerical/hjb_solvers/hjb_fdm_multid.py`: Core splitting algorithm
- `mfg_pde/alg/numerical/hjb_solvers/hjb_fdm.py`: Dimension detection and routing

**Key Functions**:
```python
solve_hjb_nd_dimensional_splitting(M_density, U_final, U_prev, problem, ...)
    # Main entry point for nD FDM with splitting

_sweep_dimension(U, M, problem, dt, dim, ...)
    # Sweep along dimension `dim` using itertools.product()

_solve_1d_hjb_slice(U_slice, M_slice, problem, dt, dim, slice_indices, ...)
    # Solve single 1D HJB problem for one slice

_Problem1DAdapter(full_problem, sweep_dim, fixed_indices)
    # Adapter class: makes nD GridBasedMFGProblem look like 1D MFGProblem
```

**Complexity**:
- **Per timestep**: d sweeps (forward + backward)
- **Per sweep**: N^(d-1) independent 1D solves
- **Per 1D solve**: O(N × Newton_iterations)
- **Total**: O(d × N^d × Newton_iterations) per timestep

**Example (3D, 30×30×30 grid)**:
- 3 dimensions → 6 sweeps per timestep
- 30² = 900 independent 1D solves per sweep
- ~5,400 1D solves per timestep
- Each 1D solve is embarrassingly parallel (future optimization)

### Theory

**Strang Splitting Formula**:

For PDE: ∂u/∂t = L_x(u) + L_y(u) + L_z(u)

Approximate solution operator:
```
U(t + Δt) ≈ S_x(Δt/2) ∘ S_y(Δt/2) ∘ S_z(Δt) ∘ S_y(Δt/2) ∘ S_x(Δt/2) U(t)
```

where S_i(Δt) is the solution operator for dimension i.

**Splitting Error**:
- Symmetric splitting: O(Δt²) global error
- Exact for problems with L_x L_y = L_y L_x (commuting operators)
- For HJB: exact when Hamiltonian has no cross-derivatives

## Method 2: GFDM (Generalized Finite Difference Method)

### Overview

**Approach**: Meshfree method using local polynomial approximation
**Key Idea**: Compute derivatives from scattered neighbors via least squares
**Implementation**: Production-ready in MFG_PDE

### Algorithm

For each point x_i and each timestep:
1. **Find neighbors**: k nearest neighbors of x_i
2. **Local polynomial**: Fit polynomial p(x) ≈ u(x) near x_i
3. **Derivatives**: Evaluate ∇p(x_i), Δp(x_i) from polynomial
4. **PDE solve**: Use derivatives in HJB/FP discretization

### Advantages

✅ **Exact for cross-derivatives**: No splitting approximation
✅ **Flexible geometry**: Works on irregular domains, obstacles
✅ **Dimension-agnostic**: Same code for 2D, 3D, 4D, ...
✅ **Production-ready**: Tested and validated
✅ **Adaptive**: Can use non-uniform point distributions

### Limitations

⚠️ **Tuning required**: k_neighbors parameter affects stability
⚠️ **Slower**: More complex than FDM per point
⚠️ **Conditioning**: Ill-conditioned for very irregular point clouds

### When to Use

**Good for**:
- Anisotropic MFG problems (cross-derivatives important)
- Irregular domains (obstacles, curved boundaries)
- Production code requiring robustness
- Adaptive mesh refinement

**Not recommended for**:
- Very high dimensions (d > 4) due to curse of dimensionality
- Real-time applications (slower than FDM splitting)

### Implementation Details

**Files**:
- `mfg_pde/alg/numerical/hjb_solvers/gfdm_hjb.py`: HJB solver
- `mfg_pde/alg/numerical/fp_solvers/gfdm_fp.py`: FP solver
- `mfg_pde/geometry/meshfree/`: Geometry utilities

**Key Configuration**:
```python
from mfg_pde.alg.numerical.hjb_solvers import GFDMHJBSolver

solver = GFDMHJBSolver(
    problem,
    k_neighbors=20,  # More neighbors = more stable but slower
    polynomial_degree=2,  # Usually 2 is sufficient
)
```

**Complexity**:
- **Neighbor search**: O(N log N) with KD-tree
- **Per point**: O(k³) for polynomial fit (k = k_neighbors)
- **Total per timestep**: O(N × k³)

### Theory

**Local Polynomial Approximation**:

Near point x_i, approximate u(x) by polynomial:
```
p(x) = c₀ + c₁(x-x_i) + c₂(y-y_i) + c₃(x-x_i)² + c₄(x-x_i)(y-y_i) + ...
```

Determine coefficients {c_j} by minimizing:
```
∑_{x_j ∈ neighbors} w_j [u(x_j) - p(x_j)]²
```

where w_j are weights (e.g., inverse distance).

**Derivative Computation**:
- ∂u/∂x(x_i) = c₁
- ∂u/∂y(x_i) = c₂
- ∂²u/∂x²(x_i) = 2c₃
- ∂²u/∂x∂y(x_i) = c₄

## Method 3: Adaptive Eulerian (Research, External)

### Overview

**Approach**: Hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian
**Key Idea**: Use particles to find good point distribution, then freeze for PDE solve
**Implementation**: Research code in mfg-research repository

**Location**: `mfg-research/experiments/maze_navigation/adaptive_eulerian_mfg_solver.py`

### Algorithm

**Phase 1: Lagrangian Adaptation**
1. Initialize particles from initial density m₀
2. Evolve particles following FP equation (Lagrangian)
3. Particles cluster where density is high

## Design Philosophy: Why Multiple Methods?

### Principle 1: No One-Size-Fits-All

Different MFG problems have different needs:
- **Simple crowd dynamics** → FDM splitting (fast, simple)
- **Complex anisotropic** → GFDM (exact, robust)
- **Research exploration** → Adaptive/particle (novel, flexible)

### Principle 2: Classical + Modern

- **Classical methods** (FDM) provide trusted baselines
- **Modern methods** (GFDM, particles) push research frontier
- Having both enables validation and comparison

### Principle 3: Production + Research

- **Production code** (MFG_PDE): Stable, tested, documented
- **Research code** (mfg-research): Experimental, flexible, evolving
- Clear separation prevents research instability from affecting production

## Dimension-Agnostic Infrastructure

### Common Components (Dimension-Independent)

**Problem Classes**:
```python
# 1D
from mfg_pde.core.mfg_problem import MFGProblem

# nD (arbitrary dimension)
from mfg_pde.core.highdim_mfg_problem import (
    HighDimMFGProblem,      # Abstract base
    GridBasedMFGProblem,    # Concrete: regular grids
)
```

**Geometry**:
```python
from mfg_pde.geometry.grids.tensor_grid import TensorProductGrid

# Works for any dimension
grid_2d = TensorProductGrid(dimension=2, bounds=[(0,1), (0,1)], Nx_points=[50, 50])
grid_3d = TensorProductGrid(dimension=3, bounds=[(0,1)]*3, Nx_points=[30]*3)
grid_4d = TensorProductGrid(dimension=4, bounds=[(0,1)]*4, Nx_points=[10]*4)
```

**Solver Interface**:
```python
# All solvers inherit from BaseHJBSolver
solver = HJBFDMSolver(problem)  # Automatically detects dimension
solver.solve_hjb_system(M_density, U_final, U_prev)  # Works for 1D/2D/3D/...
```

### Convention: Arrays Exclude Right Boundary

**GridBasedMFGProblem arrays**:
- Grid has `num_points[d]` points per dimension (e.g., 10 points)
- Arrays have shape `num_points[d] - 1` (e.g., 9 values)
- Interpretation: x₀, x₁, ..., x₈ (includes left boundary, excludes right)

**Rationale**: Matches FDM interior-point convention, simplifies Dirichlet BCs

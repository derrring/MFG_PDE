# Reinforcement Learning Development Roadmap for MFG_PDE

**Status**: [IN PROGRESS] Phase 1 Complete - Core algorithms in development
**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Scope**: Complete reinforcement learning paradigm for Mean Field Games
**Priority**: Medium (post-reorganization expansion)

## Executive Summary

With the successful completion of the algorithm reorganization establishing three core paradigms (numerical, optimization, neural), this roadmap outlines the development of a fourth paradigm: **Reinforcement Learning for Mean Field Games**. This paradigm will bridge multi-agent reinforcement learning with classical MFG theory, providing agent-based approaches to MFG problems.

## Strategic Context

### Position in MFG_PDE Evolution
The RL paradigm represents the next major expansion of MFG_PDE's capabilities:

**Completed Foundation** (September 2025):
- âœ… **Numerical Paradigm**: 16 algorithms (finite difference, particle methods)
- âœ… **Optimization Paradigm**: 3 algorithms (variational methods)
- âœ… **Neural Paradigm**: 9 components (PINNs, neural operators)

**Next Expansion** (Planned):
- ðŸ”„ **Reinforcement Learning Paradigm**: Agent-based MFG approaches

### Mathematical Motivation

Mean Field Reinforcement Learning (MFRL) addresses a fundamental gap in MFG solution approaches:

**Classical MFG**: Solves population-level PDEs directly
**MFRL**: Learns equilibrium through agent interactions and population feedback

This paradigm is especially valuable for:
- **Dynamic environments** with changing parameters
- **Unknown or partially observable** MFG systems
- **Multi-objective** and **multi-population** games
- **Finite-population** approximations to mean field limits

### Core Mathematical Framework

#### 1. Mean Field RL Formulation
**Individual Agent Problem**:
```
max E[âˆ‘_{t=0}^T r(s_t, a_t, m_t) | Ï€, m]
```
Where `m_t` is the population state (mean field) at time `t`.

**Population Consistency**:
```
m_t = E[Ï†(s_t) | Ï€]  # Population state matches agent distribution
```

#### 2. Algorithm Categories

**Value-Based Approaches**:
- **Mean Field Q-Learning**: Learn Q(s,a,m) functions
- **Distributional RL**: Learn value distributions over population states
- **Nash-Q variants**: Multi-agent equilibrium learning

**Policy-Based Approaches**:
- **Population Policy Gradients**: âˆ‡_Î¸ J(Î¸, m)
- **Mean Field Actor-Critic**: Separate value and policy learning
- **Multi-Population Methods**: Handle heterogeneous agent types

**Hybrid Approaches**:

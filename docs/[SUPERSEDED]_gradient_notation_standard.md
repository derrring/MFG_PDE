# [SUPERSEDED] Gradient Notation Standard

**Status**: SUPERSEDED by NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md (2025-11-05)
**Reason**: Consolidated into comprehensive naming conventions document

This document has been superseded. All gradient notation standards are now documented in:
- `docs/NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md` (Section: "Gradient Notation Standard")

The gradient notation content has been integrated alongside variable naming conventions, discretization parameters, and solver configuration standards for a unified reference.

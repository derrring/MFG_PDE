- ✅ **Optimized support**: Easy to add via Delaunay interpolation
- ✅ **Production-ready**: Suitable for mesh-based MFG problems

## Current Support Levels

### Level 1: Basic (Nearest Neighbor) - Out-of-the-Box

The projection system automatically handles FEM meshes using nearest neighbor:

```python
from mfg_pde import MFGProblem
from mfg_pde.geometry import Mesh2D, TensorProductGrid

# FEM mesh (unstructured, handles complex domains)
mesh = Mesh2D(
    domain_type="rectangle",
    bounds=(0, 1, 0, 1),
    holes=[{"type": "circle", "center": (0.5, 0.5), "radius": 0.2}],
    mesh_size=0.05
)
mesh_data = mesh.generate_mesh()

# Regular grid (structured, efficient for HJB)
grid = TensorProductGrid(bounds=(0, 1, 0, 1), resolution=(50, 50))

# Dual geometry problem (works immediately!)
problem = MFGProblem(
    hjb_geometry=grid,
    fp_geometry=mesh,
    time_domain=(1.0, 50),
    sigma=0.1
)

# Projections use nearest neighbor fallback automatically
assert problem.geometry_projector.hjb_to_fp_method == "interpolation"
assert problem.geometry_projector.fp_to_hjb_method == "nearest"
```

**Performance**: O(log N) via KD-tree, adequate for most applications.

**Accuracy**: Piecewise constant, sufficient for coarse estimates.

### Level 2: Optimized (Delaunay) - One-Time Setup

For higher accuracy, register specialized Delaunay interpolation:

```python
from scipy.interpolate import LinearNDInterpolator
from scipy.spatial import KDTree
from mfg_pde.geometry import ProjectionRegistry, Mesh2D, TensorProductGrid
import numpy as np

# Register once (e.g., in your project setup script)
@ProjectionRegistry.register(Mesh2D, TensorProductGrid, "fp_to_hjb")
def mesh_to_grid_delaunay(mesh_geo, grid_geo, mesh_values, **kwargs):
    """Project from FEM mesh to grid using Delaunay interpolation."""

    # Get mesh vertices
    vertices = mesh_geo.get_spatial_grid()  # (N_vertices, dimension)

    # Create Delaunay interpolator (respects triangulation)
    interpolator = LinearNDInterpolator(vertices, mesh_values)

    # Evaluate at grid points
    grid_points = grid_geo.get_spatial_grid()
    grid_values_flat = interpolator(grid_points)

    # Handle extrapolation (points outside mesh → nearest neighbor)
    nan_mask = np.isnan(grid_values_flat)
    if np.any(nan_mask):
        tree = KDTree(vertices)
        _, nearest_indices = tree.query(grid_points[nan_mask])
        grid_values_flat[nan_mask] = mesh_values[nearest_indices]

    # Reshape to grid
    return grid_values_flat.reshape(grid_geo.get_grid_shape())

@ProjectionRegistry.register(TensorProductGrid, Mesh2D, "hjb_to_fp")
def grid_to_mesh_interpolation(grid_geo, mesh_geo, grid_values, **kwargs):
    """Project from grid to mesh (bilinear interpolation)."""
    vertices = mesh_geo.get_spatial_grid()
    interpolator = grid_geo.get_interpolator()
    return interpolator(grid_values, vertices)

# Now all subsequent MFGProblems use optimized projections
problem = MFGProblem(hjb_geometry=grid, fp_geometry=mesh, ...)
assert problem.geometry_projector.fp_to_hjb_method == "registry"  # Uses Delaunay!
```

**Performance**: O(N log N) setup, then O(log N) per query.

**Accuracy**: Linear (C⁰ continuous), respects mesh triangulation.

## Comparison: Methods

| Method | Continuity | Accuracy | Speed | Dependencies | Use Case |
|:-------|:-----------|:---------|:------|:-------------|:---------|
| **Nearest Neighbor** | Piecewise constant | Lower | Fast | None | Prototyping, coarse |
| **Delaunay** | C⁰ (linear) | Higher | Moderate | scipy | Production, accuracy |
| **Custom** | Problem-specific | Varies | Varies | Varies | Specialized needs |

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Complex Domain with Obstacles

**Problem**: Building evacuation with complex floor plan.

**Solution**: FEM mesh naturally handles obstacles.

```python
# Complex domain (L-shaped building with rooms)
mesh = Mesh2D(
    domain_type="polygon",
    vertices=[(0,0), (2,0), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (0,2)],  # L-shape
    holes=[
        {"type": "circle", "center": (0.5, 0.5), "radius": 0.2},  # Column
        {"type": "circle", "center": (1.5, 0.5), "radius": 0.2}   # Column
    ],
    mesh_size=0.05
)

# Regular grid for fast HJB
grid = TensorProductGrid(bounds=mesh.get_bounds(), resolution=(100, 100))

problem = MFGProblem(hjb_geometry=grid, fp_geometry=mesh, ...)
```

### Use Case 2: Adaptive Refinement

**Problem**: Need fine mesh near boundaries, coarse elsewhere.

**Solution**: FEM mesh with adaptive refinement + regular grid HJB.

```python
from mfg_pde.geometry import TriangularAMRMesh

# Adaptive mesh (refines automatically near obstacles)
amr_mesh = TriangularAMRMesh(
    domain_type="rectangle",
    bounds=(0, 1, 0, 1),
    initial_refinement=2,
    max_refinement=5
)

grid = TensorProductGrid(bounds=(0, 1, 0, 1), resolution=(50, 50))

problem = MFGProblem(hjb_geometry=grid, fp_geometry=amr_mesh, ...)
```

### Use Case 3: CAD Import

**Problem**: Real-world geometry from CAD file.

**Solution**: Import CAD, mesh it, use with dual geometry.

```python
# Import CAD file (e.g., STEP, IGES format)
mesh = Mesh2D(
    domain_type="cad_import",
    cad_file="floor_plan.step",
    mesh_size=0.05
)

grid = TensorProductGrid(bounds=mesh.get_bounds(), resolution=(100, 100))

problem = MFGProblem(hjb_geometry=grid, fp_geometry=mesh, ...)
```

## Implementation Details

### How Mesh Projection Works

**FEM Mesh Structure:**
- Mesh has `N_vertices` vertices at positions `(x_i, y_i)`
- Mesh has `N_elements` triangular elements connecting vertices
- Solutions stored at vertices (FEM nodal values)

**Grid → Mesh (HJB → FP):**
1. Get mesh vertex positions: `mesh.get_spatial_grid()` → (N_vertices, 2)
2. Use grid's bilinear interpolator to evaluate at vertex positions
3. Return interpolated values at vertices

**Mesh → Grid (FP → HJB):**
1. **Nearest Neighbor** (fallback):
   - Build KD-tree from mesh vertices
   - For each grid point, find nearest vertex
   - Assign that vertex's value

2. **Delaunay** (optimal):
   - Use mesh triangulation as Delaunay triangulation
   - Linear interpolation within each triangle
   - Nearest neighbor for points outside mesh

### Why This Works

**Key Insight**: `UnstructuredMesh.get_spatial_grid()` returns vertex positions, which is exactly what we need for interpolation!

```python
# All mesh types have this method
vertices = mesh.get_spatial_grid()  # (N_vertices, dimension)

# This works for:
# - Mesh2D (triangular)
# - Mesh3D (tetrahedral)
# - TriangularAMRMesh (adaptive)
# - Any custom mesh implementing UnstructuredMesh
```

## Performance Tips

### Tip 1: Choose Mesh Resolution Wisely

```python
# Coarse mesh for FP (smooth density)
mesh_size = 0.1  # ~100 vertices

# Fine grid for HJB (sharp gradients)
grid_resolution = (100, 100)  # 10,201 points

# Projection overhead: negligible (< 1% solve time)
```

### Tip 2: Cache Projector for Repeated Use

```python
projector = problem.geometry_projector

# First call: builds KD-tree (one-time cost)
M_grid_1 = projector.project_fp_to_hjb(M_mesh_1)

# Subsequent calls: reuse cached tree (fast)
M_grid_2 = projector.project_fp_to_hjb(M_mesh_2)
M_grid_3 = projector.project_fp_to_hjb(M_mesh_3)
```

### Tip 3: Use Appropriate Method for Problem

```python
# Smooth solutions (linear PDE): Delaunay interpolation
# Discontinuous solutions (shocks): Nearest neighbor adequate
# Conservation required: Custom conservative projection
```

## Future Enhancements

### Conservative Projection (Planned)

For problems requiring strict mass conservation:

```python
@ProjectionRegistry.register(Mesh2D, TensorProductGrid, "fp_to_hjb")
def mesh_to_grid_conservative(mesh_geo, grid_geo, mesh_values, **kwargs):
    """Conservative L2 projection preserving integral."""
    # Compute mass matrix overlap integrals
    # Solve M_grid * u_grid = M_mesh * u_mesh
    # Guarantees: ∫ u_grid = ∫ u_mesh
    pass
```

### High-Order Interpolation (Planned)

For high-accuracy requirements:

```python
@ProjectionRegistry.register(Mesh2D, TensorProductGrid, "fp_to_hjb")
def mesh_to_grid_quadratic(mesh_geo, grid_geo, mesh_values, **kwargs):
    """Quadratic interpolation using element shape functions."""
    # Use P2 finite element basis functions
    # Requires mid-edge values (not just vertices)
    pass
```

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need gmsh for FEM meshes?

**A**: Yes for mesh generation, but not for projection. If you already have mesh data (e.g., from external mesher), you can load it directly.

### Q: Can I use 3D FEM meshes?

**A**: Yes! `Mesh3D` works the same way with tetrahedral elements.

```python
from mfg_pde.geometry import Mesh3D, SimpleGrid3D

mesh3d = Mesh3D(domain_type="box", bounds=(0,1,0,1,0,1), mesh_size=0.1)
grid3d = SimpleGrid3D(bounds=(0,1,0,1,0,1), resolution=(30,30,30))

problem = MFGProblem(hjb_geometry=grid3d, fp_geometry=mesh3d, ...)
```

### Q: What about mesh → mesh projections?

**A**: Currently uses nearest neighbor fallback. For production, register specialized projection respecting both triangulations.

### Q: How accurate is nearest neighbor?

**A**: Error is O(h) where h is mesh size. For h=0.05, expect ~5% relative error for smooth functions. Delaunay reduces this to O(h²).

### Q: Can I reverse the pairing (mesh HJB + grid FP)?

**A**: Yes, but typically less efficient. Grid-based HJB is usually faster than mesh-based HJB, so standard pairing (grid HJB + mesh FP) is recommended.

## Summary

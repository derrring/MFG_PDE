# MFG_PDE: Numerical Solvers for Mean Field Games

A Python package for solving Mean Field Game (MFG) systems using particle-collocation and finite difference methods.

## Quick Start

### Modern Factory Pattern (Recommended)

```python
from mfg_pde import ExampleMFGProblem, BoundaryConditions
from mfg_pde.factory import create_fast_solver
from mfg_pde.config import create_fast_config
import numpy as np

# Create an MFG problem
problem = ExampleMFGProblem(xmin=0.0, xmax=1.0, Nx=20, T=1.0, Nt=30, 
                           sigma=0.1, coefCT=0.02)

# Modern approach: Use factory pattern for one-line solver creation
config = create_fast_config()
solver = create_fast_solver(
    problem=problem, 
    solver_type="adaptive_particle",
    config=config,
    num_particles=5000
)

# Solve with structured results
result = solver.solve()
U, M = result.solution, result.density
print(f"Convergence: {result.convergence_info}")
```

### Direct Class Usage (Alternative)

```python
from mfg_pde import ExampleMFGProblem, BoundaryConditions
from mfg_pde.alg import SilentAdaptiveParticleCollocationSolver
import numpy as np

# Create an MFG problem
problem = ExampleMFGProblem(xmin=0.0, xmax=1.0, Nx=20, T=1.0, Nt=30, 
                           sigma=0.1, coefCT=0.02)

# Direct class instantiation
boundary_conditions = BoundaryConditions(type="no_flux")
collocation_points = np.linspace(0, 1, 10).reshape(-1, 1)

solver = SilentAdaptiveParticleCollocationSolver(
    problem=problem,
    collocation_points=collocation_points,
    boundary_conditions=boundary_conditions,
    num_particles=5000
)

# Solve with modern parameter names
U, M, info = solver.solve(max_picard_iterations=15, verbose=True)
print(f"Convergence mode: {solver.get_convergence_mode()}")  # "particle_aware"
```

## Core Solvers

### 1. Particle-Collocation Solver
Advanced solver combining particle methods for Fokker-Planck with generalized finite differences for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.

### 2. Optimized QP-Collocation
High-performance version with intelligent constraint detection, achieving 3-8x speedup while maintaining solution quality.

### 3. Pure FDM and Hybrid Methods
Traditional finite difference and hybrid particle-FDM approaches for comparison and validation.

## Performance

- **QP Usage**: Reduced from 100% to ~8% average usage
- **Speed**: 3-8x faster than baseline QP-Collocation
- **Accuracy**: Maintains mass conservation < 0.1% error
- **Robustness**: 100% success rate across 50+ diverse test cases

## Testing

```bash
# Run core functionality tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/

# Run comprehensive method comparisons
python tests/method_comparisons/comprehensive_final_evaluation.py

# Run mass conservation validation
python -m pytest tests/mass_conservation/
```

# --- Setuptools specific configuration ---
# This tells setuptools to automatically find packages in the current directory.
# If your package `mfg_pde` is directly in the root of your project (alongside pyproject.toml),
# this is usually sufficient.
# If `mfg_pde` is inside a `src` directory (e.g., `src/mfg_pde`), you would adjust `where`.

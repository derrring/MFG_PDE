"""
Unit tests for GFDM components (Issue #545).

This module demonstrates the proper way to test GFDM components after the
mixin-to-composition refactoring. Each component is tested independently
without requiring a full solver instantiation.

Components tested:
- GridCollocationMapper: Bidirectional grid ↔ collocation interpolation
- NeighborhoodBuilder: Stencil construction, Taylor matrices, weight functions
- BoundaryHandler: Boundary normals, LCR, ghost nodes
- MonotonicityEnforcer: QP-constrained monotonicity preservation

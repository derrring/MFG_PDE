"""
Integration test for Linear-Quadratic Common Noise MFG with analytical solution.

This test validates the CommonNoiseMFGSolver against a known analytical solution
for a simple Linear-Quadratic problem with common noise.

Mathematical Setup:
    - Hamiltonian: H(x, p, m, θ) = (p²/2) + (x²/2) + α·θ·x
    - Common Noise: dθ_t = -κθ_t dt + σ dB_t (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck)
    - Terminal cost: g(x, θ) = (x²/2)

For small coupling (α → 0), the solution is approximately:
    - u(t, x, θ) ≈ u₀(t, x) + α·θ·u₁(t, x)
    - m(t, x, θ) ≈ m₀(t, x) + α·θ·m₁(t, x)

Where u₀, m₀ solve the deterministic LQ-MFG and u₁, m₁ are first-order corrections.

This provides an analytical benchmark for convergence testing.

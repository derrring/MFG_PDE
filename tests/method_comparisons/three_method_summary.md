# Three MFG Method Comparison Summary

Based on our testing with the same MFG equation, here's a comprehensive comparison of three particle-collocation approaches:

## Test Configuration
- **Problem**: T=1.0, Nx=60, Nt=50, œÉ=0.2, coefCT=0.05
- **Boundary Conditions**: No-flux (particles reflect at boundaries)
- **Particles**: 400 particles for Fokker-Planck evolution
- **Collocation**: 15 points for HJB equation solving

## Method Comparison

### 1. Standard Particle-Collocation
- **Approach**: Standard weighted least squares for derivative approximation
- **Taylor Order**: First-order (linear approximation)
- **Constraints**: None (unconstrained optimization)
- **Characteristics**: Fast, simple, baseline approach

### 2. QP-Constrained Particle-Collocation  
- **Approach**: Constrained quadratic programming for monotonicity
- **Taylor Order**: First-order (for fair comparison)
- **Constraints**: Monotonicity bounds, stability constraints near boundaries
- **Characteristics**: Enhanced boundary compliance, monotonicity preservation

### 3. High-Order Particle-Collocation
- **Approach**: Second-order Taylor expansion with QP constraints
- **Taylor Order**: Second-order (quadratic approximation)
- **Constraints**: Full QP constraints for stability
- **Characteristics**: Higher accuracy, more computational cost

## Results Summary

## Implementation Impact

The constrained QP approach successfully addresses the fundamental limitation mentioned initially: **standard weighted least-squares methods can produce negative weights that violate the discrete maximum principle**. 

Our QP implementation with proper bounds and constraints provides:
- **Guaranteed monotonicity** through non-negative finite difference weights
- **Improved mass conservation** for longer time simulations
- **Better boundary handling** for no-flux conditions
- **Scalable performance** suitable for realistic MFG problems

This validates the theoretical advantage of constrained optimization for Mean Field Games particle-collocation methods.

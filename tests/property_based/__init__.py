"""
Property-Based Testing for MFG_PDE Package

This module contains property-based tests using the Hypothesis framework
to validate mathematical properties and numerical stability of MFG solvers
across a wide range of parameter combinations.

Property-based testing complements traditional unit tests by automatically
generating test cases that explore the parameter space systematically,
helping to discover edge cases and verify fundamental mathematical properties.
